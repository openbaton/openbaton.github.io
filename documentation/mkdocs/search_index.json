To execute the bootstrap procedure you need to have curl installed (see http://curl.haxx.se/). This command should work on any linux system:\n\n\napt-get install curl\n\n\n\n\nNOTE\n - We assume that you are performing the installation on top of a clean installation of \nUbuntu 16.04\n. To install Open Baton either on \nUbuntu 14.04\n or \nDebian Jessy\n you need first to manually install the \"openjdk-8-jre\" package. In other cases we suggest to install the components one by one. You can checkout the \nbootstrap\n repository and see the installation procedures which are executed by the bootstrap script.\n\n\nOpen Baton can be installed on any kind of environment (physical hosts, virtual machines, containers, etc.). Suggested requirements in terms of CPUs, Memory, and disk space are: \n\n\n\n\nminimal version: \n 2GB of RAM, and \n 2CPUs, 10GB of disk space\n\n\ncomplete version: \n 8GB of RAM, and \n 8CPUs, 10GB of disk space\n\n\n\n\nIn general, you may be able to get a working environment also with less perfomant hardware, especially tuning the JVM startup options (i.e -Xms and -Xmx).\n\n\nInstallation guide\n\n\nTo start the bootstrap procedure of the Open Baton environment you can type the following command:\n\n\nsh \n(curl -s http://get.openbaton.org/bootstrap) release\n\n\n\n\nAlternatively, you can have a non-interactive installation using a configuration file. Specifically, you need to have the configuration file locally available and to pass it to the bootstrap command as a parameter.\nYou can download this example of \nconfiguration file\n, modify it accordingly and execute the bootstrap typing the following command:\n\n\nsh \n(curl -s http://get.openbaton.org/bootstrap) release --config-file=\nabsolute path to your configuration file\n\n\n\n\n\nNOTE\n - If you need support, get in contact with us at: \ninfo@openbaton.org\n\n\nVERY IMPORTANT NOTE\n - By default RabbitMQ is installed on the host of the NFVO. Be aware of the fact that during the installation you will be prompted for entering the RabbitMQ IP and Port. Please make sure that this IP can be\n  reached by external components (VMs, or host where will run other VNFMs) otherwise you will have runtime issues. If you are installing Open Baton on a VM running in OpenStack, the best is that you put here\n  the floating IP.\n\n\nDuring the bootstrap procedure you will be prompted for inputs. For instance you can choose to install or not the Generic VNFM as well as other additional components, or enable or not SSL.\nFor each additional component, you can choose if install a specific version of a component or if install the latest released version (the default).\n\n\nAt the end of the bootstrap procedure, if there are no errors, the dashboard should be reachable at: \nlocalhost:8080\n.\nDepending on which additional component you decided to add to the Open Baton installation then you should have a structure similar to the following:\n\n\n/usr/lib/openbaton\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 nfvo\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 vnfm/generic\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 fms\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 ase\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 nse\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 plugins/vim-drivers\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 plugins/monitoring\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 systemd\n\n\n\n\nWhere:\n\n\n\n\nnfvo\n contains the jar file of the Open Baton NFV Orchestrator (NFVO)\n\n\nvnfm/generic\n contains the jar file of the Open Baton Generic VNF Manager (VNFMG)\n\n\nfms\n contains the jar file related of Open Baton Fault Management System (FMS)\n\n\nase\n contains the jar file related of Open Baton Auto Scaling Engine (ASE)\n\n\nnse\n contains the jar file related of Open Baton Network Slicing Engine (NSE)\n\n\nplugins/vim-drivers\n contains the VIM-Driver plugins for Open Baton. By default the Test VIM Driver plugin is installed, therefore its jar file is stored in this directory. Additionally, if during the installation procedure you decide to install the OpenStack VIM-Driver Plugin then also its jar file will be stored in this directory\n\n\nplugins/monitoring\n contains the monitoring plugins for Open Baton. If during the installation procedure you decide to install the Fault Management system then also the Zabbix plugin will be automatically installed and therefore its jar file will be stored in this directory\n\n\nsystemd\n contains the Open Baton configuration files for the system and service manager \"systemd\"\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, still depending on which additional component you decided to add to the Open Baton installation, then you should also have the following structure:\n\n\n/usr/bin\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 openbaton-nfvo\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 openbaton-vnfm-generic\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 openbaton-fms\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 openbaton-ase\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 openbaton-nse\n\n\n\n\nWhere:\n\n\n\n\nopenbaton-nfvo\n is the Open Baton NFVO executable\n\n\nopenbaton-vnfm-generic\n is the Open Baton Generic VNFM executable\n\n\nopenbaton-fms\n is the Open Baton FMS executable\n\n\nopenbaton-ase\n is the Open Baton ASE executable\n\n\nopenbaton-nse\n is the Open Baton NSE executable\n\n\n\n\nAt this point Open Baton is ready to be used. Please refer to the \nIntroduction\n on how to start using it or step into the \nhello world\n tutorial immediately.\n\n\nStarting and stopping the NFVO\n\n\nAfter the installation procedure the NFVO is running as a service.\nIf you want to stop it, enter one of the following commands depending on your OS.\n\n\n\n\nWith Ubuntu 14.04:\n\n\n\n\nsudo service openbaton-nfvo stop\nsudo stop openbaton-nfvo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith Ubuntu 16.04 or Debian Jessie:\n\n\n\n\nsudo systemctl stop openbaton-nfvo.service\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo start the NFVO (as a service), enter one of the following commands depending on your OS.\n\n\n\n\nWith Ubuntu 14.04:\n\n\n\n\nsudo service openbaton-nfvo start\nsudo start openbaton-nfvo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith Ubuntu 16.04 or Debian Jessie:\n\n\n\n\nsudo systemctl start openbaton-nfvo.service\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstead, to start and stop the NFVO as a normal process, you can use the Open Baton executables in the '/usr/bin/' folder and type the following commands:\n\n\nsudo openbaton-nfvo start\nsudo openbaton-nfvo stop\n\n\n\n\nStarting and stopping the Generic VNFM (and the other additional components)\n\n\nIf you also installed the Generic VNFM it is also already running (as a service) at the end of the installation procedure. You can stop it with one of the following commands depending on your OS.\n\n\n\n\nWith Ubuntu 14.04:\n\n\n\n\nsudo service openbaton-vnfm-generic stop\nsudo stop openbaton-vnfm-generic\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith Ubuntu 16.04 or Debian Jessie:\n\n\n\n\nsudo systemctl stop openbaton-vnfm-generic.service\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you also installed the Generic VNFM, then you can start it (as a service) with one of the following commands depending on your OS.\n\n\n\n\nWith Ubuntu 14.04:\n\n\n\n\nsudo service openbaton-vnfm-generic start\nsudo start openbaton-vnfm-generic\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith Ubuntu 16.04 or Debian Jessie:\n\n\n\n\nsudo systemctl start openbaton-vnfm-generic.service\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstead, to start and stop the Generic VNFM as a normal process, you can use the Open Baton executables in the '/usr/bin/' folder and type the following commands:\n\n\nsudo openbaton-vnfm-generic start\nsudo openbaton-vnfm-generic stop\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNOTE\n - For all the other additional components the commands above still apply just adapted to the specific component (e.g.: for the Fault Management System you can substitute the 'openbaton-vnfm-generic' with 'openbaton-fms', etc.)\n\n\nConfigure it\n\n\nFor specific configuration refer to the \nconfiguration\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      // Creating custom :external selector\n      $.expr[':'].external = function(obj){\n          return !obj.href.match(/^mailto\\:/)\n                  && (obj.hostname != location.hostname);\n      };\n      $(function(){\n        $('a:external').addClass('external');\n        $(\".external\").attr('target','_blank');\n      })",

At the end of the bootstrap procedure, if there are no errors, the dashboard should be reachable at:  localhost:8080 .\nDepending on which additional component you decided to add to the Open Baton installation then you should have a structure similar to the following:  /usr/lib/openbaton\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 nfvo\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 vnfm/generic\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 fms\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 ase\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 nse\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 plugins/vim-drivers\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 plugins/monitoring\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 systemd  Where:   nfvo  contains the jar file of the Open Baton NFV Orchestrator (NFVO)  vnfm/generic  contains the jar file of the Open Baton Generic VNF Manager (VNFMG)  fms  contains the jar file related of Open Baton Fault Management System (FMS)  ase  contains the jar file related of Open Baton Auto Scaling Engine (ASE)  nse  contains the jar file related of Open Baton Network Slicing Engine (NSE)  plugins/vim-drivers  contains the VIM-Driver plugins for Open Baton. By default the Test VIM Driver plugin is installed, therefore its jar file is stored in this directory. Additionally, if during the installation procedure you decide to install the OpenStack VIM-Driver Plugin then also its jar file will be stored in this directory  plugins/monitoring  contains the monitoring plugins for Open Baton. If during the installation procedure you decide to install the Fault Management system then also the Zabbix plugin will be automatically installed and therefore its jar file will be stored in this directory  systemd  contains the Open Baton configuration files for the system and service manager \"systemd\"   Additionally, still depending on which additional component you decided to add to the Open Baton installation, then you should also have the following structure:  /usr/bin\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 openbaton-nfvo\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 openbaton-vnfm-generic\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 openbaton-fms\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 openbaton-ase\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 openbaton-nse  Where:   openbaton-nfvo  is the Open Baton NFVO executable  openbaton-vnfm-generic  is the Open Baton Generic VNFM executable  openbaton-fms  is the Open Baton FMS executable  openbaton-ase  is the Open Baton ASE executable  openbaton-nse  is the Open Baton NSE executable   At this point Open Baton is ready to be used.

            "text": "How to configure the NFVO\n\n\nThis guide explains you how to configure the NFVO once the installation is completed. In general, after using the bootsrap procedure no changes described here are required unless you want to tune up your installation.\nIn addition to this, you may need to modify also the configuration parameters of the \nGeneric VNFM\n\n\nNFVO properties overview\n\n\nAfter the bootstrap procedure the NFVO's configuration file is located at:\n\n\n/etc/openbaton/openbaton-nfvo.properties\n\n\n\n\nThis is a property file that is used to configure the \nSpring\n environment and the \nNFVO\n. Since the component is based on the Spring framework some parameters are inherited, for a deeper explanation on all the parameters meaning, please refer to the \nSpring documentation\n.\n\n\nKeep in mind that whenever some of the parameters below referred are changed, you will need to restart the NFVO.\n\n\nModify NFVO General properties\n\n\nIMPORTANT NOTES:\n\n\nBy default RabbitMQ is installed on the host of the NFVO. Be aware of the fact that if you want any of your additional external components to be executed on a different host, you will need RabbitMQ to be reachable also from the outside.  \n\n\nIn general, also the NFVO can be executed on a different host changing the following properties of the \n/etc/openbaton/openbaton.properties\n file:\n\n\nnfvo.rabbit.brokerIp = localhost\n\n\n\n\nto:\n\n\nnfvo.rabbit.brokerIp = \nthe rabbitmq broker ip\n\n\n\n\n\nAgain, this property is very important to be set to the broker ip reachable from outside the machine were is running.\n\n\nAdditional rabbitMQ paramters required by the NFVO\n\n\nnfvo.rabbit.management.port=15672\n# Set the queues to be autodeleted after the shut down\nnfvo.rabbitmq.autodelete=true\nnfvo.rabbitmq.durable=true\nnfvo.rabbitmq.exclusive=false\n\n\n\n\nParameters related with NFVO behaviour runtime\n\n\nThis property allows the user to delete the Network Service Records no matter in which status they are. Please note that in any case it is possible to remove a Network Service Record in \nNULL\n state.\n\n\n# nfvo behaviour\nnfvo.delete.all-status = true\n# if true, after deleting a NSR, the nfvo will wait for \nnfvo.delete.vnfr.wait.timeout\n after that timeout the VMs and VNFR will be deleted anyway from the NFVO\nnfvo.delete.vnfr.wait.timeout=20\nnfvo.delete.vnfr.wait=true\n\nnfvo.history.clear=false\nnfvo.history.level=1\nnfvo.history.max-entities=250\n\n\n\n\nInitial admin password\n\n\nThe initial admin password is set via the configuration file property:\n\n\nnfvo.security.admin.password=openbaton\n\n\n\n\nPlease bare in mind that if the property is modified via APIs/dashboard, the change \nwon't be reflected in this file\n.\n\n\nParameters related with the monitoring system\n\n\nMONITORING:\n Open Baton allows the monitoring of the VMs on top of which the VNFs are executing via an external monitoring system. At the moment Zabbix is the monitoring system supported.\nIf you want to enable it, you need first to install and configure Zabbix server following the guide at this page \nZabbix server configuration\n.\nOnce the Zabbix server is correctly configured and running, you only need to add the following property:\n\n\nnfvo.monitoring.ip = the Zabbix server ip\n\n\n\n\nEvery time a new Network Service is instantiated, each VNFC (VM) is automatically registered to the Zabbix server.\n\n\nParameters related with the marketplace\n\n\nThis parameters allow you to modify the marketplace IP, in case you want to use a different catalogue for providing VNF Packages.\n\n\nnfvo.marketplace.ip=marketplace.openbaton.org\nnfvo.marketplace.port=8080\n\n\n\n\nParameters related with plugins and drivers\n\n\nThe following properties are related to the plugin mechanism used for loading VIM and Monitoring instances.\n\n\n# Setting the number of plugin active consumers\nnfvo.plugin.active.consumers=10\nnfvo.plugin.install=true\n# directory for the vim driver plugins\nnfvo.plugin.installation-dir=./plugins\nnfvo.plugin.log.path=./plugin-logs\nnfvo.plugin.wait=true\n# timeout for plugin operations\nnfvo.plugin.timeout=300000\n\n\n\n\nwhere the \nnfvo.plugin.installation-dir\n is the directory where all the jar files are located. Each of these plugins implement the VIM interface (see the \nVIM driver documentation\n), and will be automatically started by the NFVO after booting.\nWhile the \nnfvo.plugin.log.path\n defines the location where plugin log files will be available.\n\n\nParameters related with quota management\n\n\nModify this parameter in case you want to disable checking quota while deploying your network services. Be aware that the NFVO will request to the VIM its quota, so if quota is not properly set on the NFVI, you may have some issues with this. In case of any exceptions which come with some certain scenarios, you can also avoid failing on exceptions by changing the \nnfvo.quota.check.failOnException\n to \nfalse\n.\n\n\nnfvo.quota.check=false\nnfvo.quota.check.failOnException = true\n\n\n\n\nPlease consider also the property \nnfvo.vim.drivers.allowInfiniteQuota\n explained in the next section for the quota management during the allocate resources mechanism\n\n\nAddition parameters for the NFVO and VNFM tuning\n\n\n# Execute the start event sequentially and in order based on the VNFDependencies. This implies the NSD not to have cycling dependencies\nnfvo.start.ordered=false\n# It can be used for enabling/disabling an active check to the VIM authentication URL\nnfvo.vim.active.check=true\n# Allow infinite quotas during the GRANT_OPERATION\nnfvo.vim.drivers.allowInfiniteQuota=false\nnfvo.vim.delete.check.vnfr=true\n\n\n\n\nThose properties are needed in case you want to tune a bit the performances of the NFVO. When the VNFMs send a message to the NFVO, there is a pool of threads able to process these messages in parallel. These parameters allow you to change the pool configuration. For more details please check the \nspring documentation regarding thread pool executor\n.\n\n\n# Thread pool executor configuration\n# for info see http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/scheduling/concurrent/ThreadPoolTaskExecutor.html\nnfvo.vmanager.executor.corepoolsize = 20\nnfvo.vmanager.executor.maxpoolsize = 30\nnfvo.vmanager.executor.queuecapacity = 500\nnfvo.vmanager.executor.keepalive = 30\n# if true, deleting the nsd will remove also its vnfd\nnfvo.vnfd.cascade.delete=false\n# if true, deleting the vnfd will remove also its vnfpackage\nvnfd.vnfp.cascade.delete=true\n\n\n\n\nEnable SSL\n\n\nBy default SSL is disabled. Comment out those parameters in case you want to enable it.\n\n\n#server.port=8443\n#server.ssl.enabled=true\n#server.ssl.key-store=/etc/openbaton/keystore.p12\n#server.ssl.key-store-password=password\n#server.ssl.keyAlias=tomcat\n#server.ssl.keyStoreType=PKCS12\n#nfvo.https=false\n\n\n\n\nModify logging levels\n\n\nFeel free to modify that file for adding or removing specific functionalities.  For instance, you can decide to change logging levels (TRACE, DEBUG, INFO, WARN, and ERROR) and mechanisms:\n\n\n#########################################\n########## Logging properties ###########\n#########################################\n\nlogging.level.org.springframework=WARN\nlogging.level.org.hibernate=WARN\nlogging.level.org.apache=WARN\n\n# Level for loggers on classes inside the root package \norg.project.openbaton\n (and its sub-packages)\nlogging.level.org.openbaton=INFO\n\n# Direct log to a log file\nlogging.file=/var/log/openbaton.log\n\n\n\n\nModidy DB properties\n\n\nDepending on the installation mode you selected, it may be that you have an in-memory database. In order to reconfigure the NFVO to use a persistent database, like MySQL, you need to change the properties as shown below:\n\n\n#########################################\n############# DB properties #############\n#########################################\n\nspring.datasource.username=admin\nspring.datasource.password=changeme\n\n# JDBC configurations' values for HSQL:\n#       jdbc:hsqldb:file:/tmp/openbaton/openbaton.hsdb\n#       org.hsqldb.jdbc.JDBCDriver\n#       org.hibernate.dialect.HSQLDialect\n# JDBC configurations' values for MYSQL:\n#       jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/openbaton\n#       org.mariadb.jdbc.Driver\n#       org.hibernate.dialect.MySQLDialect\n#\n# Active configurations by default MySQL:\nspring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/openbaton\nspring.datasource.driver-class-name=org.mariadb.jdbc.Driver\nspring.jpa.database-platform=org.hibernate.dialect.MySQLDialect\nspring.jpa.show-sql=false\n# ddl-auto available values: create-drop, update\nspring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update\n\n# MYSQL configuration (enable it in order to avoid timeout exceptions)\n#spring.datasource.validationQuery=SELECT 1\n#spring.datasource.testOnBorrow=true\n\n\n\n\nWhere:\n\n \nspring.datasource.username\n and \nspring.datasource.password\n need to be adapted to the mysql username and password.\n\n \nspring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto\n has to be set to \nupdate\n if you want the NFVO \nnot\n to drop all the tables after being shut down and to make it reuse the same tables after restarting.\n\n\nFor more details please see the \nSpring Documentation\n regarding the configuration parameters.\n\n\nModify RabbitMQ parameters\n\n\nThese are additional parameters about the configuration of Rabbit MQ:\n\n\n#########################################\n############## RabbitMQ #################\n#########################################\n\n# Comma-separated list of addresses to which the client should connect to.\n#spring.rabbitmq.addresses=${nfvo.rabbit.brokerIp}\n# Create an AmqpAdmin bean.\nspring.rabbitmq.dynamic=true\n# RabbitMQ host.\nspring.rabbitmq.host=${nfvo.rabbit.brokerIp}\n# Acknowledge mode of container.\n#spring.rabbitmq.listener.acknowledge-mode=\n# Start the container automatically on startup.\n#spring.rabbitmq.listener.auto-startup=true\n# Minimum number of consumers.\nspring.rabbitmq.listener.concurrency=5\n# Maximum number of consumers.\nspring.rabbitmq.listener.max-concurrency=30\n# Number of messages to be handled in a single request.

First step is to build the archive which then can be onboarded to the NFVO.\nA typical VNF Package includes\n\n\n\n\nVNF Descriptor: containing all the information required by the NFVO for deploying the VNF (more information available at the \nVNF Descriptor page\n).\n\n\nImage: passed using a link to an image file (typically QCOW) available for being dowloaded via HTTP. At the moment, passing an image file inside the VNF Package is not supported: there is some work in progress to allow it.\n\n\nMetadata file providing additional information to the NFVO for understanding what's the content of the package.\n\n\nscripts: containing all the scripts which could be used for lifecycle management.\n\n\n\n\nA typical VNF Package has the following structure:\n\n\n- Metadata.yaml\n- vnfd.json\n- scripts/\n    - 1_script.sh\n    - 2_script.sh\n\n\n\n\nMetadata.yaml\n\n\nThe Metadata.yaml defines essential properties for the VNF. This file is based on the YAML syntax where information are stored in simple \nkey> : \nvalue> associations.\n\n\nThe example of the Metadata file below shows a basic definition of a VNF Package.\n\n\nname: VNF_package_name\nscripts-link: scripts_link\nvim_types: list_of_vim_types\ndescription: description_of_VNF\nprovider: provider_of_package\nnfvo_version: target_NFVO_version\nimage:\n    upload: option\n    ids: list_of_ids\n    names: list_of_names\n    link: image_link\nimage-config:\n    name: image_name\n    diskFormat: disk_format\n    containerFormat: container_format\n    minCPU: min_cpu\n    minDisk: min_disk\n    minRam: min_ram\n    isPublic: is_public\n\n\n\n\nIn the following each property is explained in more detail. Please consider also the notes since some properties are optional (or even not implemented) and if they are defined, they may have more priority than others and override them therefore.\n\n\n\n\nname\n: The name defines the name of the VNF Package itself used to store it in the database\n\n\ndescription\n: Human readable description of the VNF\n\n\nprovider\n: The creator and maintainer of the VNF\n\n\nvim_types\n: The list of the vim types that the VNF Package supports. VIM types are related to the plugin types installed on the NFVO. More info can be found \nhere\n.\n\n\nnfvo_version\n: The version of the NFVO which supports this package in the format (X.Y.Z). First two digits (X.Y) will be used for checking whether the VNF Package is supported by the NFVO on top of which is going to be on-boarded\n\n\nscripts-link\n: This link points to a public git repository where scripts are stored and could be used instead of passing all scripts inside the VNF Package\n\n\nNote\n Either you can define the scripts-link or put the scripts into the folder scripts/.\n    The scripts-link has a higher priority than the scripts located in the folder scripts/.\n    So if you set the scripts-link, the scripts in folder scripts/ are completely ignored.\n\n\nNote\n In most of the cases using script-link means that any component should be able to fetch files from that link.\n    So you need to take care about ensuring that the URL defined is publicly available.\n\n\nNote\n Scripts are executed during different lifecycle-events, and need to be referenced inside the VNF Descriptor\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimage\n:\n\n\nupload\n: Here you can choose between different options (true, false, check).\n\n\ntrue: choosing this option means to upload the defined image on all the VimInstances. It does not matter if an image with the defined name exists or not.\n\n\nfalse: choosing this option means that you assume that the image is already present on the VimInstaces and should be re-uploaded.\nIf the image does not exist, the VNF Package onboarding will throw an exception.\nIn this case the image (if defined) will be ignored.\n\n\ncheck: this option means that the VNF PackageManagement checks first if the image is available (defined in ids or names).\nIf the image does not exist, a new one with the image defined in the VNF Package will be created.\n\n\nNote\n Please use quotation marks for this option since the values are handled as strings internally.\nOtherwise true and false will be handled as a boolean that would lead to a faulty behavior when onboarding a new VNF Package.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nids\n: The list of image IDs is used to fetch the image from the corresponding VimInstance.\n    To do it, the specific VIM driver iterates over all IDs and checks if an image with that ID exists on the VimInstance.\n    The defined IDs have a higher priority than the list of names.\n    We distinguish between the following cases:\n\n\nIf it finds no image with these IDs, it continues with the list of image names.\n\n\nIf it finds one image with these IDs, this image will be used.\n\n\nIf it finds multiple images with the same ID (should never happen) or multiple IDs matching to multiple images, an exception will be thrown because it is not clear which image to use.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnames\n: The list of image names is used to fetch the image from the corresponding VimInstance.\n    To do it, manager iterates over all names and checks if an image with that name exists on the VimInstance.\n    The list of names have a lower priority than the list of IDs.\n    We distinguish between the following cases:\n\n\nIf it finds no image with that name, an exception will be thrown except you defined the upload option check.\nThen it will create a new image defined in the VNF Package.\n\n\nIf it finds one image, this image will be used.\n\n\nIf it finds multiple images with the same name or multiple names matching to multiple images, an exception will be thrown because it is not clear which image to use.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlink\n: This link points to a URL providing the image file available for being uploaded on the VIM.\n\n\nNote\n If you want to upload a new Image to the VIM you need to specify \ntrue\n or \ncheck\n in the \nupload\n option.\n    Otherwise a NotFoundException will be thrown and the VNF Package will not be onboarded.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-config\n: All the properties explained below are required to upload the image to the VIM properly.\n    In case of creating a new image this configuration will be used and is obviously mandatory.\n\n\nname\n: This defines the name for the image to upload either located directly in the VNF Package or available via the URL defined in image-link.\n\n\ndiskFormat\n: The diskFormat defines the format in which disk type the image is stored.\n\n\ncontainerFormat\n: The containerFormat defines the format in which container type the image is stored .\n\n\nminCPU\n: The minCPU defines the minimum amount of CPU cores for using this image properly.\n\n\nminDisk\n: The minDisk defines the minimum amount of disk space for using this image properly.\n\n\nminRam\n: The minRam defines the minimum amount of RAM for using this image properly.\n\n\nisPublic\n: The isPublic defines whether the image will be available publicly to all tenants on VIM or not.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVNFD>.json\n\n\nThe \nvnfd>.json contains the VirtualNetworkFunctionDescriptor (VNFD) onboarded to the Orchestrator.\nThis VNFD can later be referenced in a NSD by its ID to make use of it.\nA more detailed explanation of the VNFD can be found \nhere\n.\n\n\nNote\n You can specify any names for the file, but its extension must be \n.json\n.\n\n\nscripts\n\n\nThe scripts folder contains all the scripts required for instatiating, configuring, and starting a VNF on the Virtual Machines or containers instantiated during the lifecycle.\nThe execution order is defined by the lifecycle_events inside the VNFD. Please refer to the \nVNF Description page\n for more information about this.\n\n\nNote\n The scripts in the folder \nscripts\n are fetched only if the \nscripts-link\n is not defined in the \nMetadata.yaml\n.\n    This means that the scripts in that folder have less priority than the scripts located under \nscripts-link\n.\n\n\nNote\n Scripts are executed when a specific lifecycle event is fired and this event references to specific scripts.\n\n\nNote\n At the moment the \nscripts\n folder cannot contain subfolder. All scripts must be under the \nscripts\n folder.\n\n\nNote\n The scripts inside the \nscripts\n folder can be either shell scripts or python scripts. Runtime parameters could be passed to those scritps in different ways, depending on the VNF Manager used for managing your VNFs. We suggest you get familiar with the requirements of the VNF Manager you would like to use, before starting implementing any scripts for lifecycle management.  \n\n\nSample tutorial\n\n\nThis section provides an example about how to create, upload and make use of VNF Packages.\nThe chosen scenario is a simple network service using \niPerf\n in a server/client scenario. \niPerf is a tool for active measurements of the maximum achievable bandwidth on IP networks. \nThis tutorial is similar to the one already described in the \niperf tutorial\n, however making use of VNF packages instead of just the network service descriptor. \n\n\nCreation of VNF Packages\n\n\nFor doing so, we need to create two VNF Packages and reference them in the NSD.\nSo we need a VNF Package for the iperf server (called iperf-server) and for the iperf client (called iperf-client).\nFirst we will start with the creation of the iperf-server VNF Package and then we will create the iperf-client VNF Package.\n\n\nFirst of all we should create a directory for each VNF Package where we put all the files related to the VNF Package because in the end we need to pack them into a tar archive for onboarding it on the NFVO.\n\n\nVNF Package [iperf-server]\n\n\nThis iperf-server VNF Package has to install the iperf server and needs to provide its ip to the iperf client.\n\n\nMetadata [iperf-server]\n\n\nIn the Metadata.yaml we define the name of the VNF Package, the scripts location and also the properties for the image to use or upload.\nSince passing an image is not supported in the current release we will use the image link inside the \nMetadata.yaml\n.\nFinally, it looks as shown below.\n\n\nname: iperf-server\ndescription: iPerf server\nprovider: FOKUS\nscripts-link: https://script-link-to-git.git\nnfvo_version: 4.0.0\nvim_types:\n -

Please consider also the notes since some properties are optional (or even not implemented) and if they are defined, they may have more priority than others and override them therefore.   name : The name defines the name of the VNF Package itself used to store it in the database  description : Human readable description of the VNF  provider : The creator and maintainer of the VNF  vim_types : The list of the vim types that the VNF Package supports. VIM types are related to the plugin types installed on the NFVO. More info can be found  here .  nfvo_version : The version of the NFVO which supports this package in the format (X.Y.Z). First two digits (X.Y) will be used for checking whether the VNF Package is supported by the NFVO on top of which is going to be on-boarded  scripts-link : This link points to a public git repository where scripts are stored and could be used instead of passing all scripts inside the VNF Package  Note  Either you can define the scripts-link or put the scripts into the folder scripts/.\n    The scripts-link has a higher priority than the scripts located in the folder scripts/.\n    So if you set the scripts-link, the scripts in folder scripts/ are completely ignored.  Note  In most of the cases using script-link means that any component should be able to fetch files from that link.\n    So you need to take care about ensuring that the URL defined is publicly available.  Note  Scripts are executed during different lifecycle-events, and need to be referenced inside the VNF Descriptor    image :  upload : Here you can choose between different options (true, false, check).  true: choosing this option means to upload the defined image on all the VimInstances. It does not matter if an image with the defined name exists or not.  false: choosing this option means that you assume that the image is already present on the VimInstaces and should be re-uploaded.\nIf the image does not exist, the VNF Package onboarding will throw an exception.\nIn this case the image (if defined) will be ignored.  check: this option means that the VNF PackageManagement checks first if the image is available (defined in ids or names).\nIf the image does not exist, a new one with the image defined in the VNF Package will be created.  Note  Please use quotation marks for this option since the values are handled as strings internally.\nOtherwise true and false will be handled as a boolean that would lead to a faulty behavior when onboarding a new VNF Package.    ids : The list of image IDs is used to fetch the image from the corresponding VimInstance.\n    To do it, the specific VIM driver iterates over all IDs and checks if an image with that ID exists on the VimInstance.\n    The defined IDs have a higher priority than the list of names.\n    We distinguish between the following cases:  If it finds no image with these IDs, it continues with the list of image names.  If it finds one image with these IDs, this image will be used.  If it finds multiple images with the same ID (should never happen) or multiple IDs matching to multiple images, an exception will be thrown because it is not clear which image to use.    names : The list of image names is used to fetch the image from the corresponding VimInstance.\n    To do it, manager iterates over all names and checks if an image with that name exists on the VimInstance.\n    The list of names have a lower priority than the list of IDs.\n    We distinguish between the following cases:  If it finds no image with that name, an exception will be thrown except you defined the upload option check.\nThen it will create a new image defined in the VNF Package.  If it finds one image, this image will be used.  If it finds multiple images with the same name or multiple names matching to multiple images, an exception will be thrown because it is not clear which image to use.    link : This link points to a URL providing the image file available for being uploaded on the VIM.  Note  If you want to upload a new Image to the VIM you need to specify  true  or  check  in the  upload  option.\n    Otherwise a NotFoundException will be thrown and the VNF Package will not be onboarded.      image-config : All the properties explained below are required to upload the image to the VIM properly.\n    In case of creating a new image this configuration will be used and is obviously mandatory.  name : This defines the name for the image to upload either located directly in the VNF Package or available via the URL defined in image-link.  diskFormat : The diskFormat defines the format in which disk type the image is stored.  containerFormat : The containerFormat defines the format in which container type the image is stored .  minCPU : The minCPU defines the minimum amount of CPU cores for using this image properly.  minDisk : The minDisk defines the minimum amount of disk space for using this image properly.  minRam : The minRam defines the minimum amount of RAM for using this image properly.  isPublic : The isPublic defines whether the image will be available publicly to all tenants on VIM or not.",

You need to go to the GUI again and navigate to \nCatalogue -\n NS Descriptors\n. Open the drop down menu by clicking on \nAction\n. Afterwards you need to press the \nLaunch\n button and a window with launching options will appear. Just click on \nLaunch\n again in order to start the deployment of this NSD.\n\n\n\n\nIf you go to \nOrchestrate NS -\n NS Records\n in the menu on the left side, you can follow the deployment process and check the current status of the created NSR.\n\n\nAvailability Zones\n\n\nIf you have a vim instance onboarded of type \nopenstack\n, in the launch modal you will be able to select in which Availability Zone deploy your VNF. This option is only supported for Vim Instances of type \nopenstack\n.\n\n\nUsing the CLI\n\n\nYou can also use the CLI for deploying existing NSDs. The command needs the ID of the NSD to deploy as an argument. It can be found either by using the dashboard or getting it from the output when onboarding a new NSD as done in the previous step. The command to deploy the previously onboarded NSD looks like shown below:\n\n\n$./openbaton.sh NetworkServiceRecord-create f2086f71-4ecf-4ed8-a692-36775ebdfc68 vimmap.json keypair.json conf.json\n\n\n\n\nThe first argument is the ID of the NSD from which the NSR will be created.

It is typically used for testing that the installation of the NFVO went fine. \nIt will not launch any Virtual Machines nor actually deploy a real Network Service.\n\n\nYou can execute also the same tutorial using the \nTOSCA\n definitions. \n\n\nRequirements\n\n\nIn order to execute this scenario, you need to have the following components up and running: \n\n\n\n\nNFVO\n\n\nTest vim driver\n\n\nDummy-VNFM\n \n\n\n\n\nRun it manually\n\n\nIf not yet running start the NFVO and the Dummy-VNFM (refer to it's \nreadme\n file on how to start it).\n\nIf you installed the NFVO using the bootstrap script, the Test vim driver will be installed already.\n\nOtherwise, you have to provide it manually by cloning the \ngit repository\n and building the jar file with \n./gradlew build\n.\nNow move the built jar into \n{path-to-nfvo-source-code}/nfvo/plugins/vim-drivers\n and restart the NFVO. \n\n\nRun it with Docker\n\n\nYou can find a \ndocker-compose\n file ready to launch the required components for this tutorial. Assuming that you have installed the latest version of Docker and Docker Compose, download the file and execute the following command: \n\n\ndocker-compose -p ob -f dummy-ns.yml up -d\n\n\n\n\nFeel free to adapt the dummy-ns.yml file as you wish. \n\n\nStore the VimInstance\n\n\nUpload a VimInstance with the type \ntest\n to the NFVO (e.g. this \nVimInstance\n). \nThe type \ntest\n will make sure that the NFVO uses the Test vim driver for deploying network services.  \n\n\nFor registering the Point of Presence of type \ntest\n to the NFVO you have to upload a Vim Instance. You can use this \nVimInstance\n. \n\n\nUsing the dashboard\n\n\nIf you want to use the Dashboard (checkout the \ndashboard documentation\n for more information on how to use it), open it at the URL http://ip-where-nfvo-runs:8080 (change port and protocol if you use SSL) and log in (default username and password are \nadmin\n and \nopenbaton\n).\n\nGo to \nManage PoPs -\n PoP Instances\n and choose the Vim Instance of your choice by clicking on \nRegister a new PoP\n and selecting the Vim Instance's json file.\n\n\n\n\nUsing the CLI\n\n\nIf you want to use the CLI (checkout the [Open Baton Client documentation][cli] for more information on how to install and use it), you need to execute the following command in order to onboard the Vim Instance where \nvim-instance.json\n is the path to the Vim Instance file:\n\n\n$./openbaton.sh VimInstance-create vim-instance.json\n\n\n\n\nStore the Network Service Descriptor\n\n\nDownload this \nNSD\n and upload it to the NFVO either using the dashboard or the cli. \n\n\nUsing the dashboard\n\n\nIf you want to use the Dashboard go to \nCatalogue -\n NS Descriptors\n and choose the NSD of your choice by clicking on \nOn Board NSD -\n Upload JSON\n and selecting the Descriptor's json file.\n\n\n\n\nUsing the CLI\n\n\nIf you want to use the CLI you need to execute the following command in order to onboard the NSD:\n\n\n$./openbaton.sh NetworkServiceDescriptor-create tutorial-iperf-NSD.json\n\n\n\n\nOnce this request is processed successfully, it returns the following:\n\n\n+------------------ +------------------------------------------------------------------ + \n| PROPERTY          | VALUE                                                             | \n+------------------ +------------------------------------------------------------------ + \n| VNFD              |                                                                   | \n|                   | id: 50c89b6a-2c3e-40b0-8f85-a4ee00f93ea6 - name:  dummy-client    | \n|                   | id: 55c1bdc8-af49-48e1-a438-4f4758edb5c2 - name:  dummy-server    | \n|                   |                                                                   | \n| VNF_DEPENDENCY    |                                                                   | \n|                   | id: 863177bd-4c68-42b3-a982-fa350ace94b1                          | \n|                   |                                                                   | \n| id                | bef3c744-b02a-48f1-9d14-9ede7847bc57                              | \n|                   |                                                                   | \n| hb_version        | 1                                                                 | \n|                   |                                                                   | \n| name              | dummy-NS                                                          | \n|                   |                                                                   | \n| projectId         | 2feadcfd-87cd-404c-9f52-7d5e621d1f0c                              | \n|                   |                                                                   | \n| vendor            | Fokus                                                             | \n|                   |                                                                   | \n| version           | 0.1                                                               | \n|                   |                                                                   | \n| VLD               |                                                                   | \n|                   | id: 2cb51390-48e0-4dc6-bbd4-1fe10655a087 - name:  private         | \n|                   |                                                                   | \n+------------------ +------------------------------------------------------------------ + \n\n\n\n\nDeploy the Network Service Descriptor\n\n\nAs soon as you onboarded the NSD in the NFVO you can deploy this NSD either by using the dashboard or the CLI.\n\nThis will create a Network Service Record (NSR) but because it is a Dummy-VNFM no Virtual Machines will be launched. \n\n\nUsing the dashboard\n\n\nThis part shows you how to deploy an onboarded NSD via the dashboard. You need to go to the GUI again and navigate to \nCatalogue -\n NS Descriptors\n. Open the drop down menu by clicking on \nAction\n. Afterwards you need to press the \nLaunch\n button and a window with launching options will appear. Just click on \nLaunch\n again in order to start the deployment of this NSD.\n\n\n\n\nIf you go to \nOrchestrate NS -\n NS Records\n in the menu on the left side, you can follow the deployment process and check the current status of the created NSR.\n\n\nUsing the CLI\n\n\nYou can also use the CLI for deploying existing NSDs. The command needs the ID of the NSD to deploy as an argument. It can be found either by using the dashboard or getting it from the output when onboarding a new NSD as done in the previous step. The command to deploy the previously onboarded NSD looks like shown below:\n\n\n$./openbaton.sh NetworkServiceRecord-create bef3c744-b02a-48f1-9d14-9ede7847bc57 vimmap.json keypair.json conf.json\n\n\n\n\nThe first argument is the ID of the NSD from which the NSR will be created. The following arguments are files that can contain additional configuration while deploying. \nYou have to pass these files even if you do not want to pass any configuration like in our case. So just create the three files and fill them with empty json objects/arrays (i.e. \n{}\n and \n[]\n).\n\nThe \nvimmap.json\n and the \nconf.json\n files should contain this:\n\n\n{}\n\n\n\n\nAnd the \nkeypair.json\n file this:\n\n\n[]\n\n\n\n\nThe execution of this command produces the following output:\n\n\n+------------------------ +------------------------------------------------------------- + \n| PROPERTY                | VALUE                                                        | \n+------------------------ +------------------------------------------------------------- + \n| id                      | 50388d15-237c-40c0-9e71-357a0d9475db                         | \n|                         |                                                              | \n| vendor                  | Fokus                                                        | \n|                         |                                                              | \n| projectId               | 2feadcfd-87cd-404c-9f52-7d5e621d1f0c                         | \n|                         |                                                              | \n| task                    | Onboarding                                                   | \n|                         |                                                              | \n| version                 | 0.1                                                          | \n|                         |                                                              | \n| VLR                     |                                                              | \n|                         | id: 6fe543f9-da83-46f6-948a-10f55ad6dec1 -

So just create the three files and fill them with empty json objects/arrays (i.e.  {}  and  [] ). \nThe  vimmap.json  and the  conf.json  files should contain this:  {}  And the  keypair.json  file this:  []  The execution of this command produces the following output:  +------------------------ +------------------------------------------------------------- + \n| PROPERTY                | VALUE                                                        | \n+------------------------ +------------------------------------------------------------- + \n| id                      | 50388d15-237c-40c0-9e71-357a0d9475db                         | \n|                         |                                                              | \n| vendor                  | Fokus                                                        | \n|                         |                                                              | \n| projectId               | 2feadcfd-87cd-404c-9f52-7d5e621d1f0c                         | \n|                         |                                                              | \n| task                    | Onboarding                                                   | \n|                         |                                                              | \n| version                 | 0.1                                                          | \n|                         |                                                              | \n| VLR                     |                                                              | \n|                         | id: 6fe543f9-da83-46f6-948a-10f55ad6dec1 -

Assuming that you have installed the latest version of Docker and Docker Compose, download the \ndocker-compose\n file and execute the following command: \n\n\nHOST_IP=192.168.42.42 docker-compose -p ob -f min-compose.yml up -d\n\n\n\n\nWhere the HOST_IP parameter is the IP of your host where you are executing the docker containers. Please note that the IP must be reachable from the OpenStack environment (in particular from the VMs created)\nfor allowing the EMS agent to reach back the Generic VNFM. \n\n\nFeel free to adapt the min-compose.yml file as you wish including other components you may need.\n\n\nimportant note\n the NFVO uses the in memory database, thus anything stored in the NFVO won't be persisted after restart of the container. \n\n\nStore the Vim Instance\n\n\nFor registering the Point of Presence of type OpenStack to the NFVO you have to upload a Vim Instance. You can use the following \njson descriptor\n by changing the values to your needs.\n\n\nUsing the dashboard\n\n\nIf you want to use the Dashboard (checkout the \ndashboard documentation\n for more information on how to use it), open it at the URL http://ip-where-nfvo-runs:8080 (change port and protocol if you use SSL) and log in (default username and password are \nadmin\n and \nopenbaton\n).\n\nGo to \nManage PoPs -\n PoP Instances\n and choose the Vim Instance of your choice by clicking on \nRegister a new PoP\n and selecting the Vim Instance's json file.\n\n\n\n\nUsing the CLI\n\n\nIf you want to use the CLI (checkout the \nOpen Baton Client documentation\n for more information on how to install and use it), you need to execute the following command in order to onboard the Vim Instance where \nvim-instance.json\n is the path to the Vim Instance file:\n\n\n$./openbaton.sh VimInstance-create vim-instance.json\n\n\n\n\nStore the Network Service Descriptor\n\n\nDownload the \niPerf NSD using private IPs\n or \niPerf NSD using floating IPs\n, and upload it in the catalogue either using the dashboard or the CLI.\n\nThe difference is that the first NSD will deploy Virtual Machines without floating IPs on OpenStack whereas the second one will use floating IPs.\n\n\nUsing the dashboard\n\n\nIf you want to use the Dashboard go to \nCatalogue -\n NS Descriptors\n and choose the NSD of your choice by clicking on \nOn Board NSD -\n Upload JSON\n and selecting the Descriptor's json file.\n\n\n\n\nUsing the CLI\n\n\nIf you want to use the CLI you need to execute the following command in order to onboard the NSD:\n\n\n$./openbaton.sh NetworkServiceDescriptor-create tutorial-iperf-NSD.json\n\n\n\n\nOnce this request is processed successfully, it returns the following:\n\n\n+------------------ +------------------------------------------------------------------ +\n| PROPERTY          | VALUE                                                             |\n+------------------ +------------------------------------------------------------------ +\n| VNFD              |                                                                   |\n|                   | id: 2dd6a30d-0eee-4f88-aa45-9f3a420f341b - name:  iperf-server    |\n|                   | id: 55ac1b21-fdf0-4fe3-861e-5b1f6b5079e3 - name:  iperf-client    |\n|                   |                                                                   |\n| VNF_DEPENDENCY    |                                                                   |\n|                   | id: 123b3dc1-4310-405c-8c50-17dbb1becd2d                          |\n|                   |                                                                   |\n| id                | f2086f71-4ecf-4ed8-a692-36775ebdfc68                              |\n|                   |                                                                   |\n| hb_version        | 1                                                                 |\n|                   |                                                                   |\n| name              | NSD iperf + privateIPs                                            |\n|                   |                                                                   |\n| projectId         | 7bc76eb0-c48c-4328-a234-c779ab54cd2a                              |\n|                   |                                                                   |\n| vendor            | FOKUS                                                             |\n|                   |                                                                   |\n| version           | 1.0                                                               |\n|                   |                                                                   |\n| VLD               |                                                                   |\n|                   | id: bd65ee00-ce56-42f4-9d31-5cd220ee64a6 - name:  private         |\n|                   |                                                                   |\n+------------------ +------------------------------------------------------------------ +\n\n\n\n\nDeploy the Network Service Descriptor\n\n\nAs soon as you onboarded the NSD in the NFVO you can deploy this NSD either by using the dashboard or the CLI.\n\nThis will create a Network Service Record (NSR) and actually launch the Virtual Machines on OpenStack.\n\n\nUsing the dashboard\n\n\nThis part shows you how to deploy an onboarded NSD via the dashboard. You need to go to the GUI again and navigate to \nCatalogue -\n NS Descriptors\n. Open the drop down menu by clicking on \nAction\n. Afterwards you need to press the \nLaunch\n button and a window with launching options will appear. Just click on \nLaunch\n again in order to start the deployment of this NSD.\n\n\n\n\nIf you go to \nOrchestrate NS -\n NS Records\n in the menu on the left side, you can follow the deployment process and check the current status of the created NSR.\n\n\nUsing the CLI\n\n\nYou can also use the CLI for deploying existing NSDs. The command needs the ID of the NSD to deploy as an argument. It can be found either by using the dashboard or getting it from the output when onboarding a new NSD as done in the previous step. The command to deploy the previously onboarded NSD looks like shown below:\n\n\n$./openbaton.sh NetworkServiceRecord-create f2086f71-4ecf-4ed8-a692-36775ebdfc68 vimmap.json keypair.json conf.json\n\n\n\n\nThe first argument is the ID of the NSD from which the NSR will be created. The following arguments are files that can contain additional configuration while deploying.\nYou have to pass these files even if you do not want to pass any configuration like in our case. So just create the three files and fill them with empty json objects/arrays (i.e. \n{}\n and \n[]\n).\n\nThe \nvimmap.json\n and the \nconf.json\n files should contain this:\n\n\n{}\n\n\n\n\nAnd the \nkeypair.json\n file this:\n\n\n[]\n\n\n\n\nThe execution of this command produces the following output:\n\n\n+------------------------ +------------------------------------------------------------- +\n| PROPERTY                | VALUE                                                        |\n+------------------------ +------------------------------------------------------------- +\n| id                      | af12b18b-9aa2-4fed-9b07-bbe1dcad9c98                         |\n|                         |                                                              |\n| vendor                  | FOKUS                                                        |\n|                         |                                                              |\n| projectId               | 7bc76eb0-c48c-4328-a234-c779ab54cd2a                         |\n|                         |                                                              |\n| task                    | Onboarding                                                   |\n|                         |                                                              |\n| version                 | 1.0                                                          |\n|                         |                                                              |\n| VLR                     |                                                              |\n|                         | id: 7c9996a4-eac8-4862-872b-dfccc4ab1790 -

This means that the service is deployed correctly. For learning more about the states of a VNF Record please refer to the \nVNF Record state documentation\n.\n\n\nAdditional information about this scenario\n\n\nWhen you access your OpenStack dashboard you should be able to see the deployed Virtual Machines. One of them will act as an iPerf server and the other one as an iPerf client that connects to the server.\n\n\nThe following pictures shows the deployment.\n\n\n\n\nAs indicated by the blue arrow the iperf server is the source of a dependency and the client is the target. In this case the client needs the IP of the server in order to connect.\nLet's have a look at the NSD we used to deploy this scenario in order to see how the dependencies are described.\n\nYou will see that the NSD contains a field called \nvnf_dependency\n.\n\n\nvnf_dependency\n:[\n    {\n      \nsource\n:{\n        \nname\n:\niperf-server\n\n      },\n      \ntarget\n:{\n        \nname\n:\niperf-client\n\n      },\n      \nparameters\n:[\n        \nprivate_floatingIp\n\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n\n\n\n\nThe json array \nvnf_dependency\n may contain multiple dependencies. In our case it is just one, which describes that the VNFD named \niperf-client\n needs a parameter called \nprivate_floaingIp\n from the VNFD \niperf-server\n. This parameter can be used by the iperf-client as a variable in its lifecycle scripts.\n\n\nAlso the lifecycle scripts are specified in the NSD. For example the VNFD \niperf-client\n has the following lifecycle events:\n\n\nlifecycle_event\n:[\n        {\n          \nevent\n:\nCONFIGURE\n,\n          \nlifecycle_events\n:[\n            \nserver_configure_floatingIp.sh\n\n          ]\n        },\n        {\n          \nevent\n:\nINSTANTIATE\n,\n          \nlifecycle_events\n:[\n            \ninstall.sh\n\n          ]\n        }\n      ]\n\n\n\n\nYou can see that there is one lifecycle event called \nINSTANTIATE\n and one called \nCONFIGURE\n. Actually there exist also other lifecycle events, read about them \nhere\n.\n\nEach one will be executed at a different point in time. By execution we mean that the scripts that are listed in the \nlifecycle_events\n field will run with root permissions on the Virtual Machine.\n\nThe scripts are located in a public git repository. The url is specified in the \nvnfPackageLocation\n field in the VNFDs.\n\nIn our example the \nINSTANTIATE\n event will run first after the Virtual Machine was initialized. It will run the \ninstall.sh\n script which installs iPerf and screen on the Virtual Machine.\n\nThe \nCONFIGURE\n lifecycle event starts after the \nINSTANTIATE\n lifecycle event. The \nCONFIGURE\n lifecycle event has a special role. In the lifecycle scripts of this event the dependency parameters are available.\n\nThat is why we use this event to tell iPerf to connect to the server ip. In the example NSD that uses floating IPs the dependency parameter is called \nprivate_floatingIp\n.\nIn the \nCONFIGURE\n lifecycle script we will therefore run\n\n\nscreen -d -m -S client iperf -c $server_private_floatingIp -t 300\n\n\n\n\nYou wonder why the variable in the script has another name than the dependency parameter? Well, you have to prepend the type of the source VNFD and an underscore to the variable. This is why \nprivate_floatingIp\n becomes \nserver_private_floatingIp\n.\n\nAnd there is another restriction. In order to use the dependency parameter in the \nCONFIGURE\n script its name has to start with the source VNFD type followed by an underscore.\n\nIf you want to learn more about dependencies, lifecycle events and variables read \nthis\n section.\n\n\nThe process in details\n\n\nLet's again have a look at the sequence diagram of a create Network Service Record operation.\n\n\n\n\nWhen the Network Service Record create is called with the Iperf Network Service Descriptor's id, the steps defined in the sequence diagram above happen.\n\n\nINSTANTIATE Method\n\n\nThe first message sent to the Generic VNFM is the INSTANTIATE message \n(1)\n. This message contains the VNF Descriptor and some other parameters needed to create the VNF Record, for instance the list of Virtual Link Records. The Generic VNFM  is called and then the create Virtual Network Function Record and the Virtual Network Function Record is created \n(2)\n and sent back to the NFVO into a GrantOperation message \n(3)\n. This message will trigger the NFVO to check if there are enough resources to create that VNF Record. If so, then a GrantOperation message with the updated VNF Record is sent back to the Generic VNFManager. Then the Generic VNFManager creates an AllocateResources message with the received VNF Record and sends it to the NFVO \n(4)\n. After creating the resources (VMs) the NFVO sends back the AllocateResources message to the VNFManager. Here the instantiate method is called \n(5)\n. Inside this method, the scripts contained in the VNF Package (or the git repository containing the scripts) is sent to the EMS, the scripts are saved locally to the VM and then the Generic VNFManager will call the execution of each script defined in the VNF Descriptor \n(6)\n. Once all of the scripts are executed and there wasn't any error, the VNFManager sends the Instantiate message back to the NFVO \n(7)\n.\n\n\nMODIFY Method\n\n\nIf the VNF is target for some dependencies, like the iperf client, the MODIFY message is sent to the VNFManager by the NFVO \n(8)\n. Then the VNFManager executes the scripts contained in the CONFIGURE lifecycle event defined in the VNF Descriptor \n(9)\n, and sends back the modify message to the NFVO \n(10)\n, if no errors occurred. In this case, the scripts environment will contain the variables defined in the related VNF dependency.\n\n\nSTART Method\n\n\nHere exactly as before, the NFVO sends the START message to the Generic VNFManager \n(11)\n, and the VNFManager calls the EMS for execution of the scripts defined in the START lifecycle (none for this example) \n(12)\n. And the start message is then sent back to the NFVO meaning that no errors occurred \n(13)\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      // Creating custom :external selector\n      $.expr[':'].external = function(obj){\n          return !obj.href.match(/^mailto\\:/)\n                  && (obj.hostname != location.hostname);\n      };\n      $(function(){\n        $('a:external').addClass('external');\n        $(\".external\").attr('target','_blank');\n      })",

            "text": "When you access your OpenStack dashboard you should be able to see the deployed Virtual Machines. One of them will act as an iPerf server and the other one as an iPerf client that connects to the server.  The following pictures shows the deployment.   As indicated by the blue arrow the iperf server is the source of a dependency and the client is the target. In this case the client needs the IP of the server in order to connect.\nLet's have a look at the NSD we used to deploy this scenario in order to see how the dependencies are described. \nYou will see that the NSD contains a field called  vnf_dependency .  vnf_dependency :[\n    {\n       source :{\n         name : iperf-server \n      },\n       target :{\n         name : iperf-client \n      },\n       parameters :[\n         private_floatingIp \n      ]\n    }\n  ]  The json array  vnf_dependency  may contain multiple dependencies. In our case it is just one, which describes that the VNFD named  iperf-client  needs a parameter called  private_floaingIp  from the VNFD  iperf-server . This parameter can be used by the iperf-client as a variable in its lifecycle scripts.  Also the lifecycle scripts are specified in the NSD. For example the VNFD  iperf-client  has the following lifecycle events:  lifecycle_event :[\n        {\n           event : CONFIGURE ,\n           lifecycle_events :[\n             server_configure_floatingIp.sh \n          ]\n        },\n        {\n           event : INSTANTIATE ,\n           lifecycle_events :[\n             install.sh \n          ]\n        }\n      ]  You can see that there is one lifecycle event called  INSTANTIATE  and one called  CONFIGURE . Actually there exist also other lifecycle events, read about them  here . \nEach one will be executed at a different point in time. By execution we mean that the scripts that are listed in the  lifecycle_events  field will run with root permissions on the Virtual Machine. \nThe scripts are located in a public git repository. The url is specified in the  vnfPackageLocation  field in the VNFDs. \nIn our example the  INSTANTIATE  event will run first after the Virtual Machine was initialized. It will run the  install.sh  script which installs iPerf and screen on the Virtual Machine. \nThe  CONFIGURE  lifecycle event starts after the  INSTANTIATE  lifecycle event. The  CONFIGURE  lifecycle event has a special role. In the lifecycle scripts of this event the dependency parameters are available. \nThat is why we use this event to tell iPerf to connect to the server ip. In the example NSD that uses floating IPs the dependency parameter is called  private_floatingIp .\nIn the  CONFIGURE  lifecycle script we will therefore run  screen -d -m -S client iperf -c $server_private_floatingIp -t 300  You wonder why the variable in the script has another name than the dependency parameter? Well, you have to prepend the type of the source VNFD and an underscore to the variable. This is why  private_floatingIp  becomes  server_private_floatingIp . \nAnd there is another restriction. In order to use the dependency parameter in the  CONFIGURE  script its name has to start with the source VNFD type followed by an underscore. \nIf you want to learn more about dependencies, lifecycle events and variables read  this  section.",

In the following you will see how to create the NSD which defines the allocations of virtual resources, the installation and configuration of the the SIPp server and client. Furthermore, you can see how to create dependencies.\n\n\nThis tutorial makes use of:\n\n\n\n\nNFVO\n\n\nGeneric VNFM\n\n\nGeneric EMS\n\n\nOpenStack vim driver\n\n\n\n\nRequirements\n\n\nIn order to execute this scenario, you need to have the following components up and running:\n\n\n\n\nConfigured and running \nNFVO\n\n\nRunning \nOpenStack vim driver\n\n\nRunning \nGeneric VNFM\n\n\nConfigured and running OpenStack environment\n\n\n\n\nRun it with Docker\n\n\nYou can find a \ndocker-compose\n file ready to launch the required components for this tutorial. Assuming that you have installed the latest version of Docker and Docker Compose, download the \ndocker-compose\n file and execute the following command: \n\n\nHOST_IP=192.168.42.42 docker-compose -p ob -f min-compose.yml up -d\n\n\n\n\nWhere the HOST_IP parameter is the IP of your host where you are executing the docker containers. Please note that the IP must be reachable from the OpenStack environment (in particular from the VMs created)\nfor allowing the EMS agent to reach back the Generic VNFM. \n\n\nFeel free to adapt the min-compose.yml file as you wish including other components you may need.\n\n\nimportant note\n the NFVO uses the in memory database, thus anything stored in the NFVO won't be persisted after restart of the container. \n\n\nStore the Vim Instance\n\n\nFor registering the Point of Presence of type OpenStack to the NFVO you have to upload a Vim Instance. You can use the following \njson descriptor\n by changing the values to your needs. \n\n\nUsing the dashboard\n\n\nIf you want to use the Dashboard (checkout the \ndashboard documentation\n for more information on how to use it), open it at the URL http://ip-where-nfvo-runs:8080 (change port and protocol if you use SSL) and log in (default username and password are \nadmin\n and \nopenbaton\n).\n\nGo to \nManage PoPs -\n PoP Instances\n and choose the Vim Instance of your choice by clicking on \nRegister a new PoP\n and selecting the Vim Instance's json file.\n\n\n\n\nUsing the CLI\n\n\nIf you want to use the CLI (checkout the \nOpen Baton Client documentation\n for more information on how to install and use it), you need to execute the following command in order to onboard the Vim Instance where \nvim-instance.json\n is the path to the Vim Instance file:\n\n\n$./openbaton.sh VimInstance-create vim-instance.json\n\n\n\n\nStore the Network Service Descriptor\n\n\nDownload the \nSIPp NSD using private IPs\n or \nSIPp NSD using floating IPs\n, and upload it in the catalogue either using the dashboard or the CLI.\n\nThe difference is that the first NSD will deploy Virtual Machines without floating IPs on OpenStack whereas the second one will use floating IPs. \n\n\nUsing the dashboard\n\n\nIf you want to use the Dashboard go to \nCatalogue -\n NS Descriptors\n and choose the NSD of your choice by clicking on \nOn Board NSD -\n Upload JSON\n and selecting the Descriptor's json file.\n\n\n\n\nUsing the CLI\n\n\nIf you want to use the CLI you need to execute the following command in order to onboard the NSD:\n\n\n$./openbaton.sh NetworkServiceDescriptor-create NetworkServiceDescriptor-SIPp-FloatingIPs.json\n\n\n\n\nOnce this request is processed successfully, it returns the following:\n\n\n+------------------ +----------------------------------------------------------------- +\n| PROPERTY          | VALUE                                                            |\n+------------------ +----------------------------------------------------------------- +\n| VNFD              |                                                                  |\n|                   | id: b9e7fb33-d777-43e2-9120-8d5ab5478c3f - name:  sipp-server    |\n|                   | id: 1f35a049-b3fc-4905-b495-d0c30e8560e1 - name:  sipp-client    |\n|                   |                                                                  |\n| VNF_DEPENDENCY    |                                                                  |\n|                   | id: 46a85018-221e-4f6e-9b58-8f2b4143a4ab                         |\n|                   |                                                                  |\n| id                | a4882ae8-8f43-4646-8a36-475b6b0560b3                             |\n|                   |                                                                  |\n| hb_version        | 1                                                                |\n|                   |                                                                  |\n| name              | NSD SIPp Floating IPs                                            |\n|                   |                                                                  |\n| projectId         | 0c60579d-a2aa-486a-b2a4-dc93f9c64fa7                             |\n|                   |                                                                  |\n| vendor            | FOKUS                                                            |\n|                   |                                                                  |\n| version           | 1.0                                                              |\n|                   |                                                                  |\n| VLD               |                                                                  |\n|                   | id: d296dbb8-b966-4d01-b8ed-01e5faf88a67 - name:  private        |\n|                   |                                                                  |\n+------------------ +----------------------------------------------------------------- +\n\n\n\n\nDeploy the Network Service Descriptor\n\n\nAs soon as you onboarded the NSD in the NFVO you can deploy this NSD either by using the dashboard or the CLI.\n\nThis will create a Network Service Record (NSR) and actually launch the Virtual Machines on OpenStack. \n\n\nUsing the dashboard\n\n\nThis part shows you how to deploy an onboarded NSD via the dashboard. You need to go to the GUI again and navigate to \nCatalogue -\n NS Descriptors\n. Open the drop down menu by clicking on \nAction\n. Afterwards you need to press the \nLaunch\n button and a window with launching options will appear. Just click on \nLaunch\n again in order to start the deployment of this NSD.\n\n\n\n\nIf you go to \nOrchestrate NS -\n NS Records\n in the menu on the left side, you can follow the deployment process and check the current status of the created NSR.\n\n\nUsing the CLI\n\n\nYou can also use the CLI for deploying existing NSDs. The command needs the ID of the NSD to deploy as an argument. It can be found either by using the dashboard or getting it from the output when onboarding a new NSD as done in the previous step. The command to deploy the previously onboarded NSD looks like shown below:\n\n\n$./openbaton.sh NetworkServiceRecord-create 82ac4b14-a014-4185-b1b2-c4b0f9b1712e vimmap.json keypair.json conf.json\n\n\n\n\nThe first argument is the ID of the NSD from which the NSR will be created. The following arguments are files that can contain additional configuration while deploying. \nYou have to pass these files even if you do not want to pass any configuration like in our case. So just create the three files and fill them with empty json objects/arrays (i.e. \n{}\n and \n[]\n).\n\nThe \nvimmap.json\n and the \nconf.json\n files should contain this:\n\n\n{}\n\n\n\n\nAnd the \nkeypair.json\n file this:\n\n\n[]\n\n\n\n\nThe execution of this command produces the following output:\n\n\n+------------------------ +------------------------------------------------------------- +\n| PROPERTY                | VALUE                                                        |\n+------------------------ +------------------------------------------------------------- +\n| id                      | a648c1fa-621e-4cc3-9f27-8e950e695d17                         |\n|                         |                                                              |\n| vendor                  | FOKUS                                                        |\n|                         |                                                              |\n| projectId               | 0c60579d-a2aa-486a-b2a4-dc93f9c64fa7                         |\n|                         |                                                              |\n| task                    | Onboarding                                                   |\n|                         |                                                              |\n| version                 | 1.0                                                          |\n|                         |                                                              |\n| VLR                     |                                                              |\n|                         | id: 492af81d-42dc-43c2-af7b-a5149451edc7 -

This means that the service is deployed correctly. For learning more about the states of a VNF Record please refer to the \nVNF Record state documentation\n.\n\n\nConfiguration Parameters\n\n\nAdditionally, there are a bundge of parameters which can configure the SIP client to simulate several scenarios such as increasing number of calls, changing the call rates or changing the transport mode. These parameters can be changed inside the NSD directly or provided during the launch of the NSD. Below you can find the configuration parameters as put in the SIPp NSD, in particular in the SIPp client VNFD. Checkout the following overview of all available paramters and the meanings.\n\n\nconfigurations\n: {\n    \nconfigurationParameters\n: [\n        {\n            \nconfKey\n: \nSIPP_LENGTH\n,\n            \nvalue\n: \n0\n,\n            \ndescription\n: \nControls the length (in milliseconds) of calls. More precisely, this controls the duration of 'pause' instructions in the scenario, if they do not have a 'milliseconds' section. Default value is 0.\n\n        },\n        {\n            \nconfKey\n: \nSIPP_RATE\n,\n            \nvalue\n: \n10\n,\n            \ndescription\n: \nSet the call rate (in calls per seconds). Default is 10. If the -rp option is used, the call rate is calculated with the period in ms given by the user.\n\n        },\n        {\n            \nconfKey\n: \nSIPP_RATE_PERIOD\n,\n            \nvalue\n: \n1000\n,\n            \ndescription\n: \nSpecify the rate period in milliseconds for the call rate.  Default is 1 second.  This allows you to have n calls every m milliseconds (by using -r n -rp m). Example: -r 7 -rp 2000 ==\n 7 calls every 2 seconds.\n\n        },\n        {\n            \nconfKey\n: \nSIPP_RATE_MAX\n,\n            \nvalue\n: \n10\n,\n            \ndescription\n: \nIf -rate_increase is set, then quit after the rate reaches this value. Example: -rate_increase 10 -max_rate 100 ==\n increase calls by 10 until 100 cps is hit.\n\n        },\n        {\n            \nconfKey\n: \nSIPP_RATE_INCREASE\n,\n            \nvalue\n: \n0\n,\n            \ndescription\n: \nSpecify the rate increase every -fd seconds.  This allows you to increase the load for each independent logging period. Example: -rate_increase 10 -fd 10 ==\n increase calls by 10 every 10 seconds.\n\n        },\n        {\n            \nconfKey\n: \nSIPP_RTP_ECHO\n,\n            \nvalue\n: \n10\n,\n            \ndescription\n: \nEnable RTP echo. RTP/UDP packets received on port defined by -mp are echoed to their sender. RTP/UDP packets coming on this port + 2 are also echoed to their sender (used for sound and video echo).\n\n        },\n        {\n            \nconfKey\n: \nSIPP_TRANSPORT_MODE\n,\n            \nvalue\n: \nu1\n,\n            \ndescription\n: \nSet the transport mode: - u1: UDP with one socket (default), - un: UDP with one socket per call, - ui: UDP with one socket per IP address The IP addresses must be defined in the injection file. - t1: TCP with one socket, - tn: TCP with one socket per call, - l1: TLS with one socket, - ln: TLS with one socket per call, - c1: u1 + compression (only if compression plugin loaded), - cn: un + compression (only if compression plugin loaded).\n\n        }\n    ],\n    \nname\n: \nsipp-configuration\n\n}\n\n\n\n\nDependencies between VNFs\n\n\nWhen you access your OpenStack dashboard you should be able to see the deployed Virtual Machines. One of them will act as a SIPp server and the other one as a SIPp client that connects to the server. \n\n\nIn this scenario the SIPp server is the source of a dependency and the client is the target. This mean the client needs the IP of the server in order to connect.\nLet's have a look at the NSD we used to deploy this scenario in order to see how the dependencies are described.\n\nYou will see that the NSD contains a field called \nvnf_dependency\n. \n\n\nvnf_dependency\n:[\n    {\n      \nsource\n:{\n        \nname\n:\nsipp-server\n\n      },\n      \ntarget\n:{\n        \nname\n:\nsipp-client\n\n      },\n      \nparameters\n:[\n        \nprivate\n\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n\n\n\n\nThe json array \nvnf_dependency\n may contain multiple dependencies. In our case it is just one, which describes that the VNFD named \nsipp-client\n needs a parameter called \nprivate\n from the VNFD \nsipp-server\n. This parameter can be used by the sipp-client as a variable in its lifecycle scripts. \n\n\nAlso the lifecycle scripts are specified in the NSD. For example the VNFD \nsipp-client\n has the following lifecycle events: \n\n\nlifecycle_event\n:[\n                {\n                    \nevent\n:\nCONFIGURE\n,\n                    \nlifecycle_events\n:[\n                        \nserver_sipp_start.sh\n\n                    ]\n                },\n                {\n                    \nevent\n:\nINSTANTIATE\n,\n                    \nlifecycle_events\n:[\n                        \nsipp_install.sh\n\n                    ]\n                }\n            ]\n\n\n\n\nYou can see that there is one lifecycle event called \nINSTANTIATE\n and one called \nCONFIGURE\n. Actually there exist also other lifecycle events, read about them \nhere\n.\n\nEach one will be executed at a different point in time. By execution we mean that the scripts that are listed in the \nlifecycle_events\n field will run with root permissions on the Virtual Machine.\n\nThe scripts are located in a public git repository. The url is specified in the \nvnfPackageLocation\n field in the VNFDs.\n\nIn our example the \nINSTANTIATE\n event will run first after the Virtual Machine was initialized. It will run the \nsipp_install.sh\n script which installs SIP and screen on the Virtual Machine.\n\nThe \nCONFIGURE\n lifecycle event starts after the \nINSTANTIATE\n lifecycle event. The \nCONFIGURE\n lifecycle event has a special role. In the lifecycle scripts of this event the dependency parameters are available.\n\nThat is why we use this event to tell SIP to connect to the server ip. In the example NSD that uses floating IPs the dependency parameter is called \nprivate\n. \nIn the \nCONFIGURE\n lifecycle script we will therefore run \n\n\nscreen -d -m -S client sipp -sn uac $server_private -d $SIPP_LENGTH -r $SIPP_RATE -rp $SIPP_RATE_PERIOD -rate_increase $SIPP_RATE_INCREASE -fd $SIPP_RATE_INCREASE -rate_max $SIPP_RATE_MAX -rtp_echo -t $SIPP_TRANSPORT_MODE -trace_msg -trace_screen -trace_err -trace_rtt -trace_logs -trace_rtt -trace_logs\n\n\n\n\nYou wonder why the variable in the script has another name than the dependency parameter? Well, you have to prepend the type of the source VNFD and an underscore to the variable. This is why \nprivate\n becomes \nserver_private\n.\n\nAnd there is another restriction. In order to use the dependency parameter in the \nCONFIGURE\n script its name has to start with the source VNFD type followed by an underscore.\n\nIf you want to learn more about dependencies, lifecycle events and variables read \nthis\n section. \n\n\nThe process in details\n\n\nLet's again have a look at the sequence diagram of a create Network Service Record operation.\n\n\n\n\nWhen the Network Service Record create is called with the SIP Network Service Descriptor's id, the steps defined in the sequence diagram above happen.\n\n\nINSTANTIATE Method\n\n\nThe first message sent to the Generic VNFM is the INSTANTIATE message \n(1)\n. This message contains the VNF Descriptor and some other parameters needed to create the VNF Record, for instance the list of Virtual Link Records. The Generic VNFM  is called and then the create Virtual Network Function Record and the Virtual Network Function Record is created \n(2)\n and sent back to the NFVO into a GrantOperation message \n(3)\n. This message will trigger the NFVO to check if there are enough resources to create that VNF Record. If so, then a GrantOperation message with the updated VNF Record is sent back to the Generic VNFManager. Then the Generic VNFManager creates an AllocateResources message with the received VNF Record and sends it to the NFVO \n(4)\n. After creating the resources (VMs) the NFVO sends back the AllocateResources message to the VNFManager. Here the instantiate method is called \n(5)\n. Inside this method, the scripts contained in the VNF Package (or the git repository containing the scripts) is sent to the EMS, the scripts are saved locally to the VM and then the Generic VNFManager will call the execution of each script defined in the VNF Descriptor \n(6)\n. Once all of the scripts are executed and there wasn't any error, the VNFManager sends the Instantiate message back to the NFVO \n(7)\n. \n\n\nMODIFY Method\n\n\nIf the VNF is target for some dependencies, like the SIP client, the MODIFY message is sent to the VNFManager by the NFVO \n(8)\n. Then the VNFManager executes the scripts contained in the CONFIGURE lifecycle event defined in the VNF Descriptor \n(9)\n, and sends back the modify message to the NFVO \n(10)\n, if no errors occurred. In this case, the scripts environment will contain the variables defined in the related VNF dependency.\n\n\nSTART Method\n\n\nHere exactly as before, the NFVO sends the START message to the Generic VNFManager \n(11)\n, and the VNFManager calls the EMS for execution of the scripts defined in the START lifecycle (none for this example) \n(12)\n. And the start message is then sent back to the NFVO meaning that no errors occurred \n(13)\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      // Creating custom :external selector\n      $.expr[':'].external = function(obj){\n          return !obj.href.match(/^mailto\\:/)\n                  && (obj.hostname != location.hostname);\n      };\n      $(function(){\n        $('a:external').addClass('external');\n        $(\".external\").attr('target','_blank');\n      })",

So just create the three files and fill them with empty json objects/arrays (i.e.  {}  and  [] ). \nThe  vimmap.json  and the  conf.json  files should contain this:  {}  And the  keypair.json  file this:  []  The execution of this command produces the following output:  +------------------------ +------------------------------------------------------------- +\n| PROPERTY                | VALUE                                                        |\n+------------------------ +------------------------------------------------------------- +\n| id                      | a648c1fa-621e-4cc3-9f27-8e950e695d17                         |\n|                         |                                                              |\n| vendor                  | FOKUS                                                        |\n|                         |                                                              |\n| projectId               | 0c60579d-a2aa-486a-b2a4-dc93f9c64fa7                         |\n|                         |                                                              |\n| task                    | Onboarding                                                   |\n|                         |                                                              |\n| version                 | 1.0                                                          |\n|                         |                                                              |\n| VLR                     |                                                              |\n|                         | id: 492af81d-42dc-43c2-af7b-a5149451edc7 -

            "text": "When you access your OpenStack dashboard you should be able to see the deployed Virtual Machines. One of them will act as a SIPp server and the other one as a SIPp client that connects to the server.   In this scenario the SIPp server is the source of a dependency and the client is the target. This mean the client needs the IP of the server in order to connect.\nLet's have a look at the NSD we used to deploy this scenario in order to see how the dependencies are described. \nYou will see that the NSD contains a field called  vnf_dependency .   vnf_dependency :[\n    {\n       source :{\n         name : sipp-server \n      },\n       target :{\n         name : sipp-client \n      },\n       parameters :[\n         private \n      ]\n    }\n  ]  The json array  vnf_dependency  may contain multiple dependencies. In our case it is just one, which describes that the VNFD named  sipp-client  needs a parameter called  private  from the VNFD  sipp-server . This parameter can be used by the sipp-client as a variable in its lifecycle scripts.   Also the lifecycle scripts are specified in the NSD. For example the VNFD  sipp-client  has the following lifecycle events:   lifecycle_event :[\n                {\n                     event : CONFIGURE ,\n                     lifecycle_events :[\n                         server_sipp_start.sh \n                    ]\n                },\n                {\n                     event : INSTANTIATE ,\n                     lifecycle_events :[\n                         sipp_install.sh \n                    ]\n                }\n            ]  You can see that there is one lifecycle event called  INSTANTIATE  and one called  CONFIGURE . Actually there exist also other lifecycle events, read about them  here . \nEach one will be executed at a different point in time. By execution we mean that the scripts that are listed in the  lifecycle_events  field will run with root permissions on the Virtual Machine. \nThe scripts are located in a public git repository. The url is specified in the  vnfPackageLocation  field in the VNFDs. \nIn our example the  INSTANTIATE  event will run first after the Virtual Machine was initialized. It will run the  sipp_install.sh  script which installs SIP and screen on the Virtual Machine. \nThe  CONFIGURE  lifecycle event starts after the  INSTANTIATE  lifecycle event. The  CONFIGURE  lifecycle event has a special role. In the lifecycle scripts of this event the dependency parameters are available. \nThat is why we use this event to tell SIP to connect to the server ip. In the example NSD that uses floating IPs the dependency parameter is called  private . \nIn the  CONFIGURE  lifecycle script we will therefore run   screen -d -m -S client sipp -sn uac $server_private -d $SIPP_LENGTH -r $SIPP_RATE -rp $SIPP_RATE_PERIOD -rate_increase $SIPP_RATE_INCREASE -fd $SIPP_RATE_INCREASE -rate_max $SIPP_RATE_MAX -rtp_echo -t $SIPP_TRANSPORT_MODE -trace_msg -trace_screen -trace_err -trace_rtt -trace_logs -trace_rtt -trace_logs  You wonder why the variable in the script has another name than the dependency parameter? Well, you have to prepend the type of the source VNFD and an underscore to the variable. This is why  private  becomes  server_private . \nAnd there is another restriction. In order to use the dependency parameter in the  CONFIGURE  script its name has to start with the source VNFD type followed by an underscore. \nIf you want to learn more about dependencies, lifecycle events and variables read  this  section.",

The path to this file can be set with nfvo.plugin.log.path properties in the /etc/openbaton/openbaton.properties.\nCongratulations you have your version of the interface for your Vim Instance that will be used by NFVO\n\n\nUse my plugin\n\n\nOnce you copied the jar file into the right folder, either you need to (re)start the NFVO or you type \ninstallPlugin\n in the NFVO console passing the needed arguments. In case you restart the NFVO, the plugin will automatically register and you can see that there will be a log file in the NFVO folder called \nplugin-myPlugin.log\n containing the logs of the plugin. The myPlugin now acts as a normal plugin so for using it check out the \nVim instance documentation\n in order to point out to the new plugin.\n\n\nNOTE\n: you can also launch your plugin from your command line just typing\n\n\n$ java -jar myPlugin-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      // Creating custom :external selector\n      $.expr[':'].external = function(obj){\n          return !obj.href.match(/^mailto\\:/)\n                  && (obj.hostname != location.hostname);\n      };\n      $(function(){\n        $('a:external').addClass('external');\n        $(\".external\").attr('target','_blank');\n      })",

Please refer to the juju \ninstallation guide\n\n\nThe \nJuju-VNFM\n needs to run on the same machine where Juju is installed\n\n\n\n\nHow to install the Juju VNF Manager from source code\n\n\nGit clone the project into the /opt/openbaton directory (you may need to be logged in as root user, unless you change the permissions on the /opt/openbaton folder): \n\n\nsudo apt-get install openjdk-7-jdk #in case you don't have java installed\nmkdir /opt/openbaton\ngit clone https://github.com/openbaton/juju-vnfm.git\n\n\n\n\nAnd Execute \n\n\ncd /opt/openbaton/juju-vnfm; ./juju-vnfm.sh compile\n\n\n\n\nto compile it. \n\n\nConfigure the Juju VNF Manager\n\n\nThe Juju VNF Manager uses AMQP to communicate with the NFVO, therefore it needs to reach RabbitMQ in order to properly register with the NFVO.\n\nIn order to configure the VNFM to reach the proper NFVO you need to modify the juju configuration file. First of all, copy the application.properties file into the following location\n\n\nsudo mkdir /etc/openbaton/ # in case it does not exists\nsudo cp src/main/resources/application.properties /etc/openbaton/\n\n\n\n\nThen change open it with your favourite editor and modify the properties \nspring.rabbitmq.host\n and \nspring.rabbitmq.port\n adding the ip address and port on which rabbitmq is running. Please make sure to update also the \nspring.rabbitmq.username\n and \nspring.rabbitmq.password\n with the one used also on the NFVO side. \n\n\nHow to control the Juju VNF Manager\n\n\nTo start the Juju VNF Manager execute\n\n\nbash\n cd /opt/openbaton/juju-vnfm\n ./juju-vnfm.sh start\n\n\nThis will create a new screen window which you can access using \nscreen -x openbaton\n. \n\n\nHow to use the Juju VNF Manager\n\n\nTo use the Juju VNF Manager for deploying a network service you have to store a VimInstance with type \ntest\n in the NFVO \nand the Virtual Network Function Descriptors used to describe the network service have to define their \nendpoint\n as \njuju\n. \nNow you can launch the NSD as usual. Juju uses Ubuntu series names to specify which image to use while deploying a charm.\nYou can specify this series in the application.properties, the default is trusty. \n\n\nIf you want to deploy a charm from the Juju Charm Store you have to set the VNFD's \nvnfPackageLocation\n to \njuju charm store\n \nand name the VNFD after the charm name. \nThis will cause the Juju VNFM to deploy the specified charm from the Juju Charm Store. \nThis is currently a fairly simple mechanism and does not provide further integration into the Open Baton Network Service deployment. \nSo it is not possible to include a VNFD that specifies a Juju Charm that has dependencies to other VNFDs or to pass configurations while deploying the Charm. \n\n\nHow it works\n\n\n\n\nThe Juju VNFM translates Open Baton NSD's into Juju Charms, stores them in directories in \n/tmp/openbaton/juju\n and deploys them \nusing an already running Juju controller.\n\nAfter the NFVO transmitted the last START event of a Network Service to the Juju VNFM, the charm is \ncreated and the juju deploy command called. If dependencies exist, the Juju VNFM will also add relations between the charms. \nThe charm directory will be removed afterwards. \nIn the following diagram you can see the work flow. \n\n\n\n\nThe basic lifecycle mapping between the Open Baton and the Juju model maps Open Baton's INSTANTIATE lifecycle to Juju's install hook, the START lifecycle \nto the start hook and the TERMINATE lifecycle to the stop hook. \nBut since Open Baton and Juju handle dependencies differently you cannot simply map Open Baton's CONFIGURE lifecycle to an existing Juju hook. \nThe following table shows in which VNFD dependency cases which Open Baton lifecycle is mapped to which Juju hook. \nThat means the scripts used by this lifecycle event will be executed by the corresponding Juju hook. \n\n\n\n\nIf the VNFD is a target of a dependency the START lifecycle will not be mapped to the start hook because the lifecycle's scripts \nshould be executed after the relation-changed hook which runs the CONFIGURE scripts. \nIn these cases a \nstartAfterDependency\n script will be created and the relation-changed hook will trigger its execution after it has finished.",

your own VNFManager you need to prepare your programming environment by installing/configuring the following requirements:\n\n\n\n\nJDK 8 (\ninstallation\n)\n\n\nGradle 1.12 or above (\ninstallation\n)\n\n\n\n\nDevelop your own VNFManager\n\n\nThis part is going to describe the steps you need to do to develop your own VNFManager with the help of any vnfm-sdk.\n\n\nThe practical parts of implementing a basic VNFManager will focus on the usage of a specific vnfm-sdk, namely the vnfm-sdk-amqp.\n\n\nPreparations\n\n\nThis section describes the initial steps for creating the project structure and configuring essential files for developing your own VNFManager.\nThis can be done in two ways.\nEither you may use your favorite IDE or you may do everything manually via the command line.\n\n\nOnce this is done, you can start implementing your VNFManager by using different communication models, the catalogue and several helpers.\n\n\nUsing your favorite IDE\n\n\nIn the following we will create the project and setup the configuration files by using your favorite IDE.\nSo first of all, start your IDE and go to the next step.\nAll the details base on the usage of \nIntelliJIdea\n.\n\n\nCreate a new project\n\n\nOnce you have started the IDE, click on File -\n New -\n Project...\n\n\nIn this dialog click on Gradle on the left and select java in the main properties window in the middle.\n\n\n\n\nThen click on next to go to the next window.\n\n\nIn the next dialog you need to define the GroupId, ArtifactId and the Version.\nMore information on the specific meaning can be found \nhere\n.\n\n\n\n\nContinue with the next dialog.\n\n\nIn this dialog you need to specify which gradle you want to use.\nIt is recommend to use the default gradle wrapper.\nAdditionally you can enable the auto-import.\n\n\n\n\nContinue with the next dialog by clicking on Next.\n\n\nIn the last dialog, you need to define the project name and the project location.\n\n\n\n\nOnce this is done you can click on Finish and continue with creating the Main Class.\n\n\nCreate the Main Class\n\n\nAfterwards, you need to create the Main Class of the VNFManager which will be started in the end.\nFor doing so, right click on the root folder my-vnfm, then click on New -\n Directory and insert what is show below.\n\n\n\n\nClick on OK to continue.\n\n\nAdditionally you need to create a new package.\nThis is done by a right-click on the previously created directory java.\nClick on New -\n Package.\nHere you can define the package name.\n\n\n\n\nFinally you can create your Main Class by clicking (right click) on the previously created package and click on New -\n Java Class.\n\n\n\n\nOnce you did all these steps, the initial project structure is created.\nWhat we miss right now is the configuration of the gradle files to define and fetch dependencies we need for implementing the VNFManager.\nThis is described in later sections.\n\n\nCreate the properties files\n\n\nThe properties files are used to define several parameters you need at runtime.\nSo just create the following file structure.\n\n\nDo a right-click on the main folder located in the src folder.\nClick on New -\n Directory and create a new folder with the name resources.\n\n\nDo again a right-click on the newly created folder resources and click on New -\n File.\nThis you need to do two times.\nThe first file is called application.properties and the second one is called conf.properties.\n\n\nWhat these files should contain is explained \nhere\n.\n\n\nUsing the command line\n\n\nThis section refers to the developers which don't like to use any IDE.\nBy not using any IDE we need to create all the folders and configuration files manually.\nSo we start with creating the project structure, the Main Class, initializing the gradle wrapper and according configuration files.\n\n\nCreate project folder\n\n\nFirst of all you need to create a new directory for your VNFManager.\nHere we call the new VNFManager my-vnfm.\nSo this can be replaced by whatever you want.\n\n\n$ mkdir my-vnfm\n\n\n\n\nCreate the Main Class\n\n\nThe Main class is the most important class you need to consider.\nHere you implement your main method and also methods you need to have for your VNFManager.\nFurther explanations are done in the according sections.\nThis is only for creating a proper file structure.\nSo execute the following commands to create the Main class in a proper folder and package structure.\n\n\nFirst, you need to create the folders and package by executing the following command in your root folder of the project.\n\n\n$ mkdir -p src/main/java/org/openbaton/vnfm\n\n\n\n\nThis creates the java folder src/main/java with the proposed package name org.openbaton.vnfm.\n\n\nIn the next step you create the Main Class called MyVNFM in this case.\n\n\n$ vim src/main/java/org/openbaton/vnfm/MyVNFM.java\n\n\n\n\nAt this point you create only the basic Java Class used later as the Main Class for implementing your VNFManager.\nThe newly created Java Class should contain the following lines for now.\n\n\npackage org.openbaton.vnfm;\n\npublic class MyVNFM {\n}\n\n\n\n\nIf you have chosen a different package name you need to replace it as well at this point.\nOnce this is done, you need to initialize the gradle wrapper and configuring according files.\n\n\nThe Build.Gradle file\n\n\nFirst you need to create the build.gradle file by executing the following command from your root project folder.\n\n\n$ vim build.gradle\n\n\n\n\nThis gradle configuration file needs to contain initially the following lines.\n\n\nbuildscript {\n    repositories {\n        mavenCentral()\n    }\n\n    dependencies {\n        classpath(\norg.springframework.boot:spring-boot-gradle-plugin:1.3.1.RELEASE\n)\n    }\n}\n\napply plugin: 'java'\napply plugin: 'spring-boot'\n\n\n\n\nThe second gradle configuration is called settings.gradle.\nThis file contains only the project name.\nSo create a new file called settings.gradle in your root folder.\n\n\n$ vim settings.gradle\n\n\n\n\nAfterwards you need to add the following line containing your project name.\nIn our case my-vnfm.\n\n\nrootProject.name = 'my-vnfm'\n\n\n\n\nAfterwards go back to the root folder and run the following command to create automatically the gradle wrapper which is used for code management and compilation.\nFor more information on how to use the gradle wrapper have a look at the gradle wrapper documentation \nhere\n.\n\n\n$ gradle wrapper\n\n\n\n\nOnce you did all these steps, the initial project structure is created.\nWhat we miss right now is the configuration of the gradle files to define and fetch dependencies we need for implementing the VNFManager.\nThis is described in later sections.\n\n\nCreate the properties files\n\n\nThe properties files are used to define several parameters you need at runtime.\nSo just create the following file structure by executing the following commands.\n\n\n$ mkdir src/main/resources\n\n\n\n\nNow you need to create two new files by running both commands you can find in the following\n\n\n$ touch src/main/resources/application.properties\n$ touch src/main/resources/conf.properties\n\n\n\n\nWhat these files should contain is explained \nhere\n.\n\n\nConfigure Gradle\n\n\nFinally you need to extend your build.gradle for announcing the Main Class, plugins to apply and repositories to use.\nSo open the build.gradle an add missing line so that the file contains the following line.\n\n\n//...\n\nbootRepackage {\n    mainClass = 'org.openbaton.vnfm.MyVNFM'\n}\n\n//...\n\n\n\n\nTake care about the configuration of the mainClass.\nIf the name or package of your mainClass is different, you need to replace it here as well.\n\n\nProperty files\n\n\nThe previously created properties files are used to define several things.\nThey are located in src/main/resources and are called application.properties and conf.properties.\n\n\nThe \napplication.properties\n contains parameters for setting up all log levels. This file is useful for configuring the springframework (see \nSpring Boot configuration file\n). This file can contain the following lines.\n\n\n\nvnfm.type=my-vnfm\nvnfm.endpoint=my-vnfm-endpoint\nvnfm.endpoint.type = RABBIT\n\nlogging.level.org.springframework=INFO\nlogging.level.org.hibernate=INFO\nlogging.level.org.apache=INFO\nlogging.level.org.jclouds=WARN\n# logging.level.org.springframework.security=WARN\nlogging.level.org.springframework.web = WARN\n\n# Level for loggers on classes inside the root package \norg.project.openbaton\n (and its\n# sub-packages)\nlogging.level.org.openbaton=INFO\n\n# Direct log to a log file\nlogging.file=/var/log/openbaton.log\n\nvnfm.rabbitmq.brokerIp=localhost\nvnfm.rabbitmq.management.port=15672\nvnfm.rabbitmq.autodelete=true\nvnfm.rabbitmq.durable=false\nvnfm.rabbitmq.exclusive=false\nvnfm.rabbitmq.minConcurrency=5\nvnfm.rabbitmq.maxConcurrency=15\n\n#########################################\n############## RabbitMQ #################\n#########################################\n\n# Comma-separated list of addresses to which the client should connect to.\n# spring.rabbitmq.addresses= 192.168.145.54\n# Create an AmqpAdmin bean.\n# spring.rabbitmq.dynamic=true\n# RabbitMQ host.\nspring.rabbitmq.host=${vnfm.rabbitmq.brokerIp}\n# Acknowledge mode of container.\n# spring.rabbitmq.listener.acknowledge-mode=\n# Start the container automatically on startup.\n# spring.rabbitmq.listener.auto-startup=true\n# Minimum number of consumers.\nspring.rabbitmq.listener.concurrency=5\n# Maximum number of consumers.\nspring.rabbitmq.listener.max-concurrency=30\n# Number of messages to be handled in a single request.

Check out next section\n\n\n\n\n\n\nenabled\n\n\ntrue if you want your vnfm to be enabled\n\n\n\n\n\n\nallocate\n\n\ntrue if the VNFM will ALLOCATE_RESOURCES, false if the NFVO will do\n\n\n\n\n\n\nconcurrency\n\n\nThe number of concurrent Receiver (only for vnfm-sdk-amqp)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChoose a vnfm-sdk\n\n\nBefore you can start with the implementation you need to select the type of communication you want to use for the communication between the Orchestrator (NFVO) and the VNFManager.\nEither you can use the vnfm-sdk-amqp for using the \nRabbitMQ\n or the vnfm-sdk-rest for using the \nReST\n interface.\nHowever, your choice doesn't effect the upcoming implementation, because the communication itself is done automatically in the background.\nBut have in mind that both libraries depend on \nSpringBoot\n.\nSo, if you want to avoid this dependency, a third option might be: just use the simple vnfm-sdk artifact.\nBy using the simple vnfm-sdk you need to take care about all the communication between NFVO and VNFManager by yourself.\n\n\nOnce you have imported one of the vnfm-sdks you will have access to all the model classes and the vnfm-sdk classes needed to implement a VNFManager.\n\n\nThe following section shows you how to import the vnfm-sdk-amqp, representative for all the other opportunities.\n\n\nImport a vnfm-sdk\n\n\nThis section shows how to import and configure your VNFManager to make use of the vnfm-sdk-amqp.\n\n\nFor gathering the vnfm-sdk-amqp library you need to import the libraries by adding the missing lines to your build.gradle:\n\n\n//...\n\ndependencies {\n    compile 'org.hibernate:hibernate-core:4.3.10.Final'\n    compile 'org.openbaton:vnfm-sdk-amqp:5.2.0'\n}\n\n//...\n\n\n\n\nNote\n To make use of the vnfm-sdk-rest you need to change 'vnfm-sdk-amqp' to 'vnfm-sdk-rest' only.\n\n\nSo the final build.gradle file results like:\n\n\nbuildscript {\n    repositories {\n        mavenCentral()\n    }\n    dependencies {\n        classpath(\norg.springframework.boot:spring-boot-gradle-plugin:1.3.1.RELEASE\n)\n    }\n\n}\n\napply plugin: 'java'\napply plugin: 'spring-boot'\n\nrepositories {\n    mavenCentral()\n    /**\n     * Only needed for openbaton snapshots dependencies\n     */\n    maven {\n        url 'https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/'\n    }\n}\n\ndependencies {\n    compile 'org.openbaton:vnfm-sdk-amqp:5.2.0'\n    compile 'org.hibernate:hibernate-core:4.3.10.Final'\n}\n\ngroup 'your.group'\nversion '1.0-SNAPSHOT'\n\nbootRepackage {\n    mainClass = 'org.openbaton.vnfm.MyVNFM'\n}\n\n\n\n\nOnce you did this, you need to trigger the gradle build process by running the following command via the command line in your project's root folder.\n\n\n$ ./gradlew build\n\n\n\n\nThis will fetch all the dependencies defined in the build.gradle and gives you access to all the Classes you need.\nYou can also do this by using the IDE by running the corresponding gradle task.\n\n\nImplementation of the VNFManager\n\n\nThis section is going to describe the implementation of a basic VNFManager by using the vnfm-sdk-amqp.\nIn the end, the VNFManager will be able to allocate and terminate resources by using its own openstack-plugin.\n\n\nSo first of all you need to define the main method used for starting your VNFManager.\nSo add the following to your Main Class that it looks as follows:\n\n\npackage org.openbaton.vnfm;\n\nimport org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;\n\npublic class MyVNFM {\n\n    public static void main(String[] args){\n        SpringApplication.run(MyVNFM.class);\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nAfterwards you need to extend your Main Class (in this case MyVNFM) with the \nAbstractVnfmSpringAmqp\n.\n\n\nThe \nAbstractVnfmSpringAmqp\n takes care of all the configuration you need to register/unregister the VNFManager to the NFVO and handles incoming messages.\nWhereas the \nAbstractVnfm\n, extended by the \nAbstractVnfmSpringAmqp\n, is independent of the type of communication.\nThis means more in detail that the \nAbstractVnfm\n processes the incoming messages and executes the right method depending on the defined Action inside the message.\nMoreover, it is responsible for loading predefined configuration files, setting up the VNFManager itself, creating the VNFR (based on the VNFD received in the first step) and doing essential parts like requesting the NFVO for granting operations or deciding who is responsible for allocate resources.\n\n\nOnce you extended your VNFMManger, you need to implement all the methods coming from the extension of \nAbstractVnfmSpringAmqp\n as shown below:\n\n\npackage org.openbaton.vnfm;\n\nimport org.openbaton.catalogue.mano.record.VNFCInstance;\nimport org.openbaton.catalogue.mano.record.VNFRecordDependency;\nimport org.openbaton.catalogue.mano.record.VirtualNetworkFunctionRecord;\nimport org.openbaton.catalogue.nfvo.Action;\nimport org.openbaton.catalogue.nfvo.VimInstance;\nimport org.openbaton.common.vnfm_sdk.amqp.AbstractVnfmSpringAmqp;\nimport org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;\nimport org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;\n\nimport java.util.Collection;\nimport java.util.Map;\n\n@SpringBootApplication\npublic class MyVNFM extends AbstractVnfmSpringAmqp{\n\n    public static void main(String[] args){\n        SpringApplication.run(MyVNFM.class);\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * This operation allows creating a VNF instance.\n     *\n     * @param virtualNetworkFunctionRecord\n     * @param scripts\n     * @param vimInstances\n     */\n    @Override\n    public VirtualNetworkFunctionRecord instantiate(VirtualNetworkFunctionRecord virtualNetworkFunctionRecord, Object scripts, Map\nString, Collection\nVimInstance\n vimInstances) throws Exception {\n        return virtualNetworkFunctionRecord;\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * This operation allows retrieving\n     * VNF instance state and attributes.\n     */\n    @Override\n    public void query() {\n\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * This operation allows scaling\n     * (out/in, up/down) a VNF instance.\n     */\n    @Override\n    public VirtualNetworkFunctionRecord scale(Action scaleInOrOut, VirtualNetworkFunctionRecord virtualNetworkFunctionRecord, VNFComponent component, Object scripts, VNFRecordDependency dependency) throws Exception {\n        return virtualNetworkFunctionRecord;\n    }\n\n\n    /**\n     * This operation allows verifying if\n     * the VNF instantiation is possible.\n     */\n    @Override\n    public void checkInstantiationFeasibility() {\n\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * This operation is called when one the VNFs fails\n     */\n    @Override\n    public VirtualNetworkFunctionRecord heal(VirtualNetworkFunctionRecord virtualNetworkFunctionRecord, VNFCInstance component, String cause) throws Exception {\n        return virtualNetworkFunctionRecord;\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * This operation allows applying a minor/limited\n     * software update (e.g. patch) to a VNF instance.\n     */\n    @Override\n    public VirtualNetworkFunctionRecord updateSoftware(Script script, VirtualNetworkFunctionRecord virtualNetworkFunctionRecord) throws Exception {\n        return virtualNetworkFunctionRecord;\n    }\n\n\n    /**\n     * This operation allows making structural changes\n     * (e.g. configuration, topology, behavior,\n     * redundancy model) to a VNF instance.\n     *\n     * @param virtualNetworkFunctionRecord\n     * @param dependency\n     */\n    @Override\n    public VirtualNetworkFunctionRecord modify(VirtualNetworkFunctionRecord virtualNetworkFunctionRecord, VNFRecordDependency dependency) throws Exception {\n        return virtualNetworkFunctionRecord;\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * This operation allows deploying a new\n     * software release to a VNF instance.\n     */\n    @Override\n    public void upgradeSoftware() {\n\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * This operation allows terminating gracefully\n     * or forcefully a previously created VNF instance.\n     *\n     * @param virtualNetworkFunctionRecord\n     */\n    @Override\n    public VirtualNetworkFunctionRecord terminate(VirtualNetworkFunctionRecord virtualNetworkFunctionRecord) {\n        log.info(\nTerminating vnfr with id \n + virtualNetworkFunctionRecord.getId());\n        return virtualNetworkFunctionRecord;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void handleError(VirtualNetworkFunctionRecord virtualNetworkFunctionRecord) {\n\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    protected void checkEMS(String hostname) {\n        log.warn(\nEMS is not supported by this VNFM\n);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    protected void checkEmsStarted(String hostname) throws RuntimeException {\n        log.warn(\nEMS is not supported by this VNFM\n);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public VirtualNetworkFunctionRecord start(VirtualNetworkFunctionRecord virtualNetworkFunctionRecord) throws Exception {\n        return virtualNetworkFunctionRecord;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public VirtualNetworkFunctionRecord stop(VirtualNetworkFunctionRecord virtualNetworkFunctionRecord) throws Exception {\n        return virtualNetworkFunctionRecord;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public VirtualNetworkFunctionRecord startVNFCInstance(VirtualNetworkFunctionRecord virtualNetworkFunctionRecord, VNFCInstance vnfcInstance) throws Exception {\n        return virtualNetworkFunctionRecord;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public VirtualNetworkFunctionRecord stopVNFCInstance(VirtualNetworkFunctionRecord virtualNetworkFunctionRecord, VNFCInstance vnfcInstance) throws Exception {\n        return virtualNetworkFunctionRecord;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public VirtualNetworkFunctionRecord configure(VirtualNetworkFunctionRecord virtualNetworkFunctionRecord) throws Exception {\n        return virtualNetworkFunctionRecord;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public VirtualNetworkFunctionRecord resume(VirtualNetworkFunctionRecord virtualNetworkFunctionRecord, VNFCInstance vnfcInstance, VNFRecordDependency dependency) throws Exception {\n        return virtualNetworkFunctionRecord;\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * This operation allows providing notifications on state changes\n     * of a VNF instance, related to the VNF Lifecycle.\n     */\n    @Override\n    public void NotifyChange() {\n\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow you can implement whatever you want. If the VirtualNetworkFunctionRecord is returned, it will go back directly to the NFVO.\n\n\nOne of the methods that can be overwritten is the \nfillParameters\n. This method is important when you have specified some \"provides\" in your VNFD, in fact you can fill them in this method and make them available afterwards to the scripts (see \nHow to use the parameters\n).\n\n\nAn example of allocating and terminating resource by using a plugin can be found \nhere\n and \nhere\n.\n\n\nNote\n If you use vnfm-sdk-amqp or vnfm-sdk-rest \nthe VNFManager main class needs to be stateless\n since it can (will) run each method potentially in parallel.\nFor what concerns vnfm-sdk-amqp, even setting concurrency to 1, will not ensure to have always the same instance of the class.\n\n\nUsing the VnfmHelper\n\n\nAdditionally you can autowire the VnfmHelper to make use of several helper methods that are very useful.\nIn this case your VNFManager should look like this:\n\n\npackage org.openbaton.vnfm;\n\nimport org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;\n\npublic class MyVNFM extends AbstractVnfmSpringAmqp {\n\n    @Autowired\n    private VnfmHelper vnfmHelper;\n\n    [...]\n}\n\n\n\n\nThe vnfmHelper helps with some methods out of the box:\n\n\npackage org.openbaton.common.vnfm_sdk;\n\nimport org.openbaton.catalogue.nfvo.messages.Interfaces.NFVMessage;\n\npublic abstract class VnfmHelper {\n\n    /**\n     * This operation sends a NFVMessage\n     * to the NFVO and doesn't wait for answer.\n     * @param nfvMessage\n     */\n    public abstract void sendToNfvo(NFVMessage nfvMessage);\n\n    /**\n     * This operation send a NFVMessage\n     * to the NFVO and waits for the answer.\n     * @param nfvMessage\n     */\n    public abstract NFVMessage sendAndReceive(NFVMessage nfvMessage) throws Exception;\n}\n\n\n\n\nAt the moment, the main purpose of the VnfmHelper is to send messages to the NFVO and wait for the answer if needed.\n\n\nNote\n This class needs to be implemented in case you want to use only the vnfm-sdk and must be provided to the AbstractVnfm.\n\n\nUsing plugins\n\n\nThis section describes the initialization and usage of plugins.\nTherefore, you need to do several things:\n\n\n\n\nStart the plugins\n\n\nConnect an according VIM to the plugin or use the plugin directly\n\n\n\n\nNote\n If you want to use the Vim with plugins, you need to fetch also the interfaces and VIM implementations by adding the following lines to your build.gradle dependencies\n\n\ncompile 'org.openbaton:vim-int:5.2.0'\ncompile 'org.openbaton:vim-impl:5.2.0'\ncompile 'org.openbaton:sdk:5.2.0'\n\n\n\n\nAfter that you need to rebuild your project for fetching the dependencies automatically.\n\n\nNow you can use the ResourceManagement interface.\nIn the end it should look like the following:\n\n\npackage org.openbaton.vnfm;\n\nimport org.openbaton.catalogue.mano.record.VNFCInstance;\nimport org.openbaton.catalogue.mano.record.VNFRecordDependency;\nimport org.openbaton.catalogue.mano.record.VirtualNetworkFunctionRecord;\nimport

So first of all you need to define the main method used for starting your VNFManager.\nSo add the following to your Main Class that it looks as follows:  package org.openbaton.vnfm;\n\nimport org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;\n\npublic class MyVNFM {\n\n    public static void main(String[] args){\n        SpringApplication.run(MyVNFM.class);\n    }\n}  Afterwards you need to extend your Main Class (in this case MyVNFM) with the  AbstractVnfmSpringAmqp .  The  AbstractVnfmSpringAmqp  takes care of all the configuration you need to register/unregister the VNFManager to the NFVO and handles incoming messages.\nWhereas the  AbstractVnfm , extended by the  AbstractVnfmSpringAmqp , is independent of the type of communication.\nThis means more in detail that the  AbstractVnfm  processes the incoming messages and executes the right method depending on the defined Action inside the message.\nMoreover, it is responsible for loading predefined configuration files, setting up the VNFManager itself, creating the VNFR (based on the VNFD received in the first step) and doing essential parts like requesting the NFVO for granting operations or deciding who is responsible for allocate resources.  Once you extended your VNFMManger, you need to implement all the methods coming from the extension of  AbstractVnfmSpringAmqp  as shown below:  package org.openbaton.vnfm;\n\nimport

If the VirtualNetworkFunctionRecord is returned, it will go back directly to the NFVO.  One of the methods that can be overwritten is the  fillParameters . This method is important when you have specified some \"provides\" in your VNFD, in fact you can fill them in this method and make them available afterwards to the scripts (see  How to use the parameters ).  An example of allocating and terminating resource by using a plugin can be found  here  and  here .  Note  If you use vnfm-sdk-amqp or vnfm-sdk-rest  the VNFManager main class needs to be stateless  since it can (will) run each method potentially in parallel.\nFor what concerns vnfm-sdk-amqp, even setting concurrency to 1, will not ensure to have always the same instance of the class.",

See \nhow to configure Zabbix server 2.2\n or \nZabbix server 3.0\n.\n\n\nOpen Baton NFVO up and running\n\n\nGit installed\n\n\n\n\nSet up environment\n\n\nCreate and give the right permissions to the folder which will host the configuration file:\n\n\nsudo mkdir -p /etc/openbaton\nsudo chwon -R $USER: /etc/openbaton\n\n\n\n\nThe Zabbix Plugin logs at default in the file \n/var/log/openbaton/openbaton-plugin-monitoring-zabbix.log\n. Create and give the right permissions in that folder running the command:\n\n\nsudo mkdir -p /var/log/openbaton\nsudo chwon -R $USER: /var/log/openbaton\n\n\n\n\nInstallation\n\n\nOnce the prerequisites are met, you can clone the following project from git, compile it using gradle and launch it:  \n\n\ngit clone https://github.com/openbaton/zabbix-plugin.git\ncd zabbix-plugin\n./gradlew build -x test\n\n\n\n\nConfiguration\n\n\nOnce you are inside the zabbix-plugin directory type this command:\n\n\ncp src/main/resources/plugin.conf.properties /etc/openbaton/openbaton-plugin-monitoring-zabbix.properties\n\n\n\n\nThe configuration parameters are explained in the following table.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParameter\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nDefault\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nzabbix-plugin-ip\n\n\nIP of the Zabbix Plugin machine\n\n\nlocalhost\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntype\n\n\nThe type of the plugin\n\n\nzabbix-plugin\n\n\n\n\n\n\nclient-request-frequency\n\n\nUpdate cache period (Basically each time t, Zabbix Plugin ask to every items value for all hosts and fill the local cache).

In particular, in a special directory defined in the Zabbix Server configuration file (/etc/zabbix/zabbix_server.conf) as AlertScriptsPath variable. If the value of the variable AlertScriptsPath is for example \"/usr/lib/zabbix/alertscripts\", \nthen copy the send_notification.sh script just created in that folder.\n\nOnce you are in the directory \"/usr/lib/zabbix/alertscripts\", add executable permissions to the script running the command:\n\n\nsudo chmod +x send_notification.sh\n\n\n\n\nNote\n: when you will use the method createThreshold, Zabbix Plugin will configure Zabbix Server automatically in order to use the script \"send_notification.sh\". \nWhat it will try to do is the configuration at this page \ncustom alertscripts\n. \nIf for any reason this auto-configuration won't work, you will see in the Zabbix Plugin logs, then you should execute this configuration manually as explained in the Zabbix documentation.\n\n\nRun the Zabbix Plugin\n\n\nSimply run the jar with:\n\n\njava -jar build/lib/openbaton-plugin-monitoring-zabbix-\nversion\n.jar\n\n\n\n\nCheck the logs in /var/log/openbaton/openbaton-plugin-monitoring-zabbix.log\n\n\nNotification mechanism\n\n\nHow does Zabbix plugin receive notifications from the Zabbix Server? \n\n\nWhen using the method createThreshold provided by the plugin, it automatically creates an \naction\n executed when the specific condition is met. \nIf the threshold is crossed (the status of the trigger goes from OK to PROBLEM or viceversa) the action is performed. The action gets the informations of the threshold and sends them to a custom alertScript.\nThe custom alertscripts is executed on the Zabbix Server and its task is to send the information received from the action to the Zabbix plugin. \n\n\nZabbix plugin waits for notifications at the url: http://zabbix-plugin-ip:defaultPort/defaultContext.\n\n\nDefault context and ports are specified in the configuration file as: \n\n \nnotification-receiver-server-context\n.\n\n \nnotification-receiver-server-port\n.\n\n\nUsing it via MonitoringPluginCaller\n\n\nIn order to use the MonitorPluginCaller you need to import the relative plugin-sdk, coming from \nOpenbaton\n project.\nTo import the plugin-sdk, please add in your Gradle file the following dependencies:\n\n\nrepositories {\n       maven { url 'https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/' }\n       maven { url 'https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/releases/'  }\n}\n\ndependencies {\n    compile 'org.openbaton:monitoring:4.0.0'\n}\n\n\n\n\nThen in your main, obtain the MonitoringPluginCaller as follows:\n\n\nMonitoringPluginCaller monitoringPluginCaller = null;\n    try {\n      monitoringPluginCaller =\n          new MonitoringPluginCaller(\n              rabbitmqIp,\n              rabbitmqUsr,\n              rabbitmqPwd,\n              5672,\n              \nzabbix-plugin\n,\n              \nzabbix\n,\n              \n15672\n,\n              120000);\n    } catch (Exception e) {\n      e.printStackTrace();\n    }\n\n\n\n\nMake sure to use the correct arguments' values.

Both interfaces send notifications with the method notify.\nAccording to ETSI specification there are 4 types of notifications. \n\n\nThe interface VirtualisedResourcePerformanceManagement sends two types of notifications:  \n\n\n\n\nPerformanceInformationAvailableNotification (NOT YET IMPLEMENTED) : this notification informs the receiver that performance information is available.     \n\n\nhresholdCrossedNotification (NOT YET IMPLEMENTED) : his notification informs the receiver that a threshold value has been crossed.  \n\n\n\n\nThe interface VirtualisedResourceFaultManagement sends the following notifications:\n\n\n\n\nAlarmNotification: This notification informs the receiver of alarms resulting from the faults related to the virtualised resources managed by the VIM. It contains the Alarm with all the information about the fault.\n\n\nAlarmStateChangedNotification: This notification informs the receiver of state change of alarm related to the virtualised resources managed by the VIM, e.g. the alarm shall be set to \u201ccleared\u201d if the corresponding fault has been solved.\n    It contains the id of the Alarm and the actual status which could be (CLEARED,FIRED,UPDATED).\n\n\n\n\nActually the zabbix-plugin when receives the notification by zabbix server, \nif the trigger has severity higher than Information\n, \nit creates an alarm (mapping zabbix notification into standard Alarm) and notify the subscribers with a AlarmNotification. If the notification is not new, then it sends an AlarmStateChangedNotification.",

The zabbix plugin can be found \nhere\n with additional information about how to use and how to compile it.\nIf the plugin is placed in the folder mentioned before, it will be started automatically when starting the AutoScaling Engine. Additionally, you can place the plugin also in the \nNFVO/plugins\n folder to let it start automatically. \n\n\nNote\n If the NFVO is already in charge of starting the plugin, you should avoid to start it a second time from the AutoScaling Engine. Once started it can be used by all components.\n\n\nStarting the AutoScaling Engine\n\n\nHow to start the ASE depends on the way you installed this component.\n\n\nDebian packages\n\n\nIf you installed the ASE with the debian packages you can start it with the following command:\n\n\nopenbaton-ase start\n\n\n\n\nFor stopping it you can just type:\n\n\nopenbaton-ase stop\n\n\n\n\nSource code\n\n\nIf you are using the source code you can start the ASE easily by using the provided script with the following command:\n\n\n./autoscaling-engine.sh start\n\n\n\n\nOnce the AutoScaling Engine is started, you can access the screen session by executing:\n\n\nscreen -r openbaton\n\n\n\n\nFor stopping you can use:\n\n\n./autoscaling-engine.sh kill\n\n\n\n\nNote\n Since the AutoScaling Engine subscribes to specific events towards the NFVO, you should take care about that the NFVO is already running when starting the AutoScaling Engine. Otherwise, the AutoScaling Engine will wait for 600 seconds for the availability of the NFVO before terminating automatically.\n\n\n How to use the AutoScaling Engine\n\n\nThis guide shows you how to make use of the AutoScaling Engine. In particular, it describes how to define AutoScaling Policies.\n\n\nCreating AutoScaling Policies\n\n\nA AutoScaling Policy defines conditions and actions in order to allow automatic scaling at runtime. The list of AutoScalePolicies are defined at the level of the VNFD/VNFR.\nAn example of an AutoScalePolicy can be found below followed by descriptions for each parameter.\n\n\nauto_scale_policy\n:[\n  {\n    \nname\n:\nscale-out\n,\n    \nthreshold\n:100,\n    \ncomparisonOperator\n:\n=\n,\n    \nperiod\n:30,\n    \ncooldown\n:60,\n    \nmode\n:\nREACTIVE\n,\n    \ntype\n:\nWEIGHTED\n,\n    \nalarms\n: [\n      {\n        \nmetric\n:\nsystem.cpu.load[percpu,avg1]\n,\n        \nstatistic\n:\navg\n,\n        \ncomparisonOperator\n:\n,\n        \nthreshold\n:0.70,\n        \nweight\n:1\n      }\n    ],\n    \nactions\n: [\n      {\n        \ntype\n:\nSCALE_OUT\n,\n        \nvalue\n:\n2\n,\n        \ntarget\n:\ntarget\n\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n]\n\n\n\n\nAn example using the \nTOSCA YAML descriptors\n can be found \nhere\n.\n\n\nThis AutoScalePolicy indicates a scaling-out operation of two new VNFC Instances if the averaged value of all measurement results of the metric \ncpu load\n is greater than the threshold of 0.7 (70%).\nThis condition is checked every 30 seconds as defined via the period. Once the scaling-out is finished it starts a cooldown of 60 seconds. For this cooldown time further scaling requests are rejected by the AutoScaling Engine.\n\n\nThe following table describes the meanings of the parameters more in detail.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParams\n\n\nMeaning\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nname\n\n\nThis is the human-readable name of the AutoScalePolicy used for identification.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nthreshold\n\n\nIs a value in percentage that indicates how many sub alarms have to be fired before firing the high-alarm of the AutoScalePolicy. For example, a value of 100 indicates that all sub alarms have to be fired in order to execute the actions of this AutoScalePolicy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncomparisonOperator\n\n\nThis comparison operator is used to check the percentages of thrown alarms. 100% means that all weighted alarms must be thrown. 50% would mean that only half of the weighted alarms must be thrown in oder to trigger the scaling action.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nperiod\n\n\nThis is the period of checking conditions of AutoScalePolicies. For example, a value of 30 indicates, that every 30 seconds all the conditions of the defined AutoScalePolicy are checked.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncooldown\n\n\nThis is the amount of time the VNF needs to wait between two scaling operations to ensure that the executed scaling action takes effect. Further scaling actions that are requested during the cooldown period are rejected.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmode\n\n\nThis defines the mode of the AutoScalePolicy. This is mainly about the way of recognizing alarms and conditions, like: \nREACTIVE\n, \nPROACTIVE\n, \nPREDICTIVE\n. At this moment \nREACTIVE\n is provided only.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntype\n\n\nThe type defines the meaning and the way of processing alarms. Here we distinguish between \nVOTED\n, \nWEIGHTED\n, \nSIMPLE\n. Currently supported is \nWEIGHTED\n\n\n\n\n\n\nalarms\n\n\nThe list of alarms defines all the alarms and conditions that belongs to the same AutoScalePolicy. The list of alarms is affected by the mode and the type of the AutoScalePolicy and influences the final check towards the threshold that decides about the triggering of the AutoScalePolicy. Each alarm is composed as defined \nhere\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nactions\n\n\nThe list of actions defines the actions that shall be executed once the conditions (alarms) of the AutoScalePolicy are met and the corresponding actions of the AutoScalePolicy are triggered. Actions are defined as show \nhere\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlarms\n\n\nAn alarm defines the conditions in order to trigger the automatic scaling.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParams\n\n\nMeaning\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmetric\n\n\nThis is the name of the metric that is considered when checking the conditions, e.g., cpu idle time, memory consumption, network traffic, etc. This metric must be available through the Monitoring System.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nstatistic\n\n\nThis defines the way of calculating the final measurement result over the group of instances. Possible values are: avg, min, max, sum, count.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncomparisonOperator\n\n\nThe comparisonOperator defines how to compare the final measurement result with the threshold. Possible values are: \n=\n, \n, \n=\n, \n, \n=\n, \n!=\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nthreshold\n\n\nThe threshold defines the value that is compared with the final measurement of a specific metric.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nweight\n\n\nThe weight defines the weight of the alarm and is used when combining all the alarms of an AutoScalePolicy to a final indicator that defines how many alarms must be fired. In this way prioritized alarms can be handled with different weights. For example, there is an alarm with the weight of three and another alarm with the weight of one. If the Alarm with weight three is fired and the second one is not fired, the final result would be 75\\% in the meaning of three quarters of the conditions are met.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nActions\n\n\nAn Action defines the operation that will be executed (if possible) when the scaling conditions are met that are defined in the Alarms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParams\n\n\nMeaning\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntype\n\n\nThe type defines the type of the action to be executed. For example, \nSCALE_OUT\n indicates that resources shall be added and \nSCALE_IN\n means that resources shall be released. Currently provided types of actions are listed \nhere\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nvalue\n\n\nThe value is related to the type of action. \nSCALE_OUT\n and \nSCALE_IN\n expects a value that defines how many instances should be scaled-out or scaled-in, \nSCALE_OUT_TO\n and \nSCALE_IN_TO\n expects a number to what the number of instances shall be scaled in or out. Supported types of actions are shown \nhere\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntarget\n\n\n[OPTIONAL] The target allows scaling of other VNFs when conditions are met of the considered VNF that includes the policy. The target points to the type of the VNF that should be scaled. If multiple VNFs has the same type, it will be chosen one of them to execute the scaling action. If the target is not defined, it will be executed scaling actions on the same VNF that includes the policy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAction types\n\n\nActions types are the operations that can be executed when defined conditions are met. The following list shows which actions are supported at the moment and what they will do.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParams\n\n\nMeaning\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCALE_OUT\n\n\nscaling-out a specific number of instances\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCALE_IN\n\n\nscaling-in a specific number of instances\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCALE_OUT_TO\n\n\nscaling-out to a specific number of instances\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCALE_IN_TO\n\n\nscaling-in to a specific number of instances",

This AutoScalePolicy indicates a scaling-out operation of two new VNFC Instances if the averaged value of all measurement results of the metric  cpu load  is greater than the threshold of 0.7 (70%).\nThis condition is checked every 30 seconds as defined via the period. Once the scaling-out is finished it starts a cooldown of 60 seconds. For this cooldown time further scaling requests are rejected by the AutoScaling Engine.  The following table describes the meanings of the parameters more in detail.     Params  Meaning      name  This is the human-readable name of the AutoScalePolicy used for identification.    threshold  Is a value in percentage that indicates how many sub alarms have to be fired before firing the high-alarm of the AutoScalePolicy. For example, a value of 100 indicates that all sub alarms have to be fired in order to execute the actions of this AutoScalePolicy.    comparisonOperator  This comparison operator is used to check the percentages of thrown alarms. 100% means that all weighted alarms must be thrown. 50% would mean that only half of the weighted alarms must be thrown in oder to trigger the scaling action.    period  This is the period of checking conditions of AutoScalePolicies. For example, a value of 30 indicates, that every 30 seconds all the conditions of the defined AutoScalePolicy are checked.    cooldown  This is the amount of time the VNF needs to wait between two scaling operations to ensure that the executed scaling action takes effect. Further scaling actions that are requested during the cooldown period are rejected.    mode  This defines the mode of the AutoScalePolicy. This is mainly about the way of recognizing alarms and conditions, like:  REACTIVE ,  PROACTIVE ,  PREDICTIVE . At this moment  REACTIVE  is provided only.    type  The type defines the meaning and the way of processing alarms. Here we distinguish between  VOTED ,  WEIGHTED ,  SIMPLE . Currently supported is  WEIGHTED    alarms  The list of alarms defines all the alarms and conditions that belongs to the same AutoScalePolicy. The list of alarms is affected by the mode and the type of the AutoScalePolicy and influences the final check towards the threshold that decides about the triggering of the AutoScalePolicy.

The rules define when to generate an alarm and how to react. \nThe rule for generating the alarm is called fault management policy (see the next section). \nThe rule for defining how to react upon alarms is a Drools Rule. Once such rules are in place, Open Baton FM follows the following workflow.\n\n\n\n\nThe actions are listed below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nACTION\n\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHeal\n\n\nThe VNFM executes the scripts in the Heal lifecycle event (in the VNFD). The message contains the cause of the fault, which can be used in the scripts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSwitch to stanby VNFC (Stateless)\n\n\nIf the VDU requires redoundancy active-passive, there will be a component VNFC\n in standby mode. This action consists in: activate the VNFC\n, route all signalling and data flow(s) for VNFC to VNFC*, deactivate VNFC.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSwitch to stanby VNFC (Stateful)\n\n\nTo investigate. Refer on ETSI GS NFV-REL 001 v1.1.1 (2015-01) Chapter 11.2.1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWrite a fault management policy\n\n\nThe fault management policy needs to be present in the VNFD, in particular in the VDU. This is an example of fault management policy:\n\n\nfault_management_policy\n:[\n    {\n      \nname\n:\nweb server not available\n,\n      \nisVNFAlarm\n: true,\n      \ncriteria\n:[\n      {\n        \nparameter_ref\n:\nnet.tcp.listen[80]\n,\n        \nfunction\n:\nlast()\n,\n        \nvnfc_selector\n:\nat_least_one\n,\n        \ncomparison_operator\n:\n=\n,\n        \nthreshold\n:\n0\n\n      }\n      ],\n      \nperiod\n:5,\n      \nseverity\n:\nCRITICAL\n\n    }\n]\n\n\n\n\nYou can find an example of the fault management policy for the \nTOSCA YAML descriptors\n \nhere\n.\n\n\nDescription of the fault management policy:  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProperty\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nname\n\n\nThis is the name of the fault management policy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nisVNFAlarm\n\n\nTrue, if the alarm is of type VNF.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncriteria\n\n\nThe criteria defines a threshold on a monitoring parameter. When the threshold is crossed an alarm is fired.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nperiod\n\n\nThe criteria is checked every \"period\" seconds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nseverity\n\n\nDefines the severity of the alarm.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription of the criteria:  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProperty\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nparameter_ref\n\n\nThis is the reference to a monitoring parameter in the VDU. (see below how to define monitoring parameters).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfunction\n\n\nThe function to apply to the parameter ( last(0) means the last value available of the parameter). Since currently only Zabbix is supported, look at the \nZabbix documentation\n for the all available functions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nvnfc_selector\n\n\nselect if the criteria is met when all VNFC components cross the threshold (all) or at least one (at_least_one)\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncomparison_operator\n\n\nThis defines the comparison operator used for the threshold.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nthreshold\n\n\nThe value of the threshold to compare against the parameter_ref value.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to refer to a monitoring parameter with the property \nparameter_ref\n, it needs to be present in the vdu:\n\n\nmonitoring_parameter\n:[\n   \nagent.ping\n,\n\n   \nnet.tcp.listen[5001]\n,\n\n   \nsystem.cpu.load[all,avg5]\n,\n\n   \nvfs.file.regmatch[/var/log/app.log,Exception]\n\n]\n\n\n\n\nYou can specify every parameter available in the \nZabbix Agent\n.\n\n\nHow the HEAL method works\n\n\nThe Heal VNF operation is a method of the VNF lifecycle management interface described in the ETSI \nNFV MANO\n specifications. Here is reported the description and the notes about this method:\n\n\nDescription: this operation is used to request appropriate correction actions in reaction to a failure.\nNotes: This assumes operational behaviour for healing actions by VNFM has been described in the VNFD. An example might be switching between active and standby mode.\n\n\n\n\nIn the ETSI draft \"NFV-IFA007v040\" at \nthis\n page, the Heal VNF message is defined as:\n\n\nvnfInstanceId\u0000 : Identifies the VNF instance requiring a healing action.\u0000\ncause : Indicates the reason why a healing procedure is required.\u0000\n\n\n\n\nOnce the fault management system received an alarm from the VIM, \nit checks, if the alarm is referred to a VNF and sends the Heal VNF message to the NFVO which forwards it to the respective VNFM.\nThe VNFM executes in the failed VNFC the scripts in the HEAL lifecycle event.\nHere an example of the heal script you can use:\n\n\n#!/bin/bash\n\ncase \n$cause\n in\n\n(\nserviceDown\n) \n    echo \nApache is down, let's try to restart it...\n\n    service apache2 restart\n    if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then\n        echo \nERROR: the Apache service is not started\n\n        exit 1\n        fi\n    echo \nThe Apache service is running again!\n\n    ;;\n*) echo \nThe cause $cause is unknown\n\n    exit 2\n    ;;\nesac\n\n\n\n\nThe variable $cause is specified in the Drools rule. In our case it is \"serviceDown\" and we try to restart the Apache server.\n\n\nDrools Rules\n\n\nThe Open Baton FMS is a rule-based system. Such rules are specified in Drools language and processed by the Drools engine in the Open Baton FMS.\nAn example rule looks like the following:\n\n\nrule \nSave a VNFAlarm\n\n    when\n        vnfAlarm : VNFAlarm()\n    then\n    VNFAlarm alarm = vnfAlarmRepository.save(vnfAlarm);\n    logger.debug(\nSaved VnfAlarm: \n+alarm);\nend\n\n\n\n\nThis rule saves a VNF Alarm in the database.\nThe following rule executes the HEAL action once a VNF Alarm is received:\n\n\nrule \nGot a critical VNF Alarm and execute the HEAL action\n\n\n    when\n       vnfAlarm : VNFAlarm(  alarmState == AlarmState.FIRED, perceivedSeverity == PerceivedSeverity.CRITICAL)\n    then\n\n    //Get the vnfr\n    VirtualNetworkFunctionRecord vnfr = nfvoRequestorWrapper.getVirtualNetworkFunctionRecord(vnfAlarm.getVnfrId());\n\n    //Get the vnfc failed (assuming only one vnfc is failed)\n    VNFCInstance vnfcInstance = nsrManager.getVNFCInstanceFromVnfr(vnfr,vnfAlarm.getVnfcIds().iterator().next());\n\n    logger.info(\n(VNF LAYER) A CRITICAL alarm is received by the vnfc: \n+vnfcInstance.getHostname());\n\n    //Get the vdu of the failed VNFC\n    VirtualDeploymentUnit vdu = nfvoRequestorWrapper.getVDU(vnfr,vnfcInstance.getId());\n\n    logger.info(\nHeal fired!\n);\n    highAvailabilityManager.executeHeal(\nserviceDown\n,vnfr.getParent_ns_id(),vnfr.getId(),vdu.getId(),vnfcInstance.getId());\n\n    //Insert a new recovery action\n\n    RecoveryAction recoveryAction= new RecoveryAction(RecoveryActionType.HEAL,vnfr.getEndpoint(),\n);\n    recoveryAction.setStatus(RecoveryActionStatus.IN_PROGRESS);\n    insert(recoveryAction);\nend\n\n\n\n\nHow the Switch to Standby works\n\n\nThe Switch to Standby action can be performed by the Open Baton FMS once a VNFC in standby is present in the VNF. Its main action is switch the service from a VNFC to the VNFC in standby automatically.\nIn order to have a VNFC in standby, such information must be included in the VNFD, in particular in the VDU, as the following:\n\n\nhigh_availability\n:{\n    \nresiliencyLevel\n:\nACTIVE_STANDBY_STATELESS\n,\n    \nredundancyScheme\n:\n1:N\n\n}\n\n\n\n\nThis information will be processed by the Open Baton FMS which will create a VNFC instance in standby.\nThen in a Drools rule this action can be called as following:\n\n\nhighAvailabilityManager.switchToRedundantVNFC(failedVnfcInstance,vnfr,vdu);\n\n\n\n\nTutorial\n\n\nThe tutorial is available at this \npage\n.",

The rules define when to generate an alarm and how to react. \nThe rule for generating the alarm is called fault management policy (see the next section). \nThe rule for defining how to react upon alarms is a Drools Rule. Once such rules are in place, Open Baton FM follows the following workflow.   The actions are listed below:     ACTION  DESCRIPTION      Heal  The VNFM executes the scripts in the Heal lifecycle event (in the VNFD). The message contains the cause of the fault, which can be used in the scripts.    Switch to stanby VNFC (Stateless)  If the VDU requires redoundancy active-passive, there will be a component VNFC  in standby mode. This action consists in: activate the VNFC , route all signalling and data flow(s) for VNFC to VNFC*, deactivate VNFC.    Switch to stanby VNFC (Stateful)  To investigate.

The fake network service is a simple iperf scenario with one server and one client. \n\n\nscenario-many-dependencies\n also uses the Dummy VNFM but its fake network service is a little bit more complex in the sense that it has many VNFD with many dependencies between them. \n\n\nThe test \nscenario-real-iperf\n actually deploys a network service on openstack. \nIt consists of two VNFD and deploys one iperf server and two iperf clients. The clients contact the server. \n\n\nThe test \nscenario-complex-ncat\n deploys a more complex network service on openstack. \nFive virtual machines will be running and acting as peers. \nThe following picture shows the architecture in which the peers connect to each other using ncat and send their ip address. \nA peer at the beginning of an arrow acts as an ncat client and connects to the peer at the end of the arrow. \nThe receiving peer stores the ip address of the sender so that it is possible to verify which peer connected to which. \nThe two colours represent the two different networks on which the peers are running and connecting. \nBlue is the network \nprivate\n and black \nprivate2\n.\n\n\n\n\nThe test \nscenario-scaling\n tests the scaling function of Openbaton. \nIt starts by deploying two VMs one acting as an ncat server and one as an ncat client which sends his ip address to the server so that it is possible to check if the client actually connected to the server. \nThen it executes some scaling functions like scale out and scale in and checks if new instances of the server and the client are deployed. Cases like scale in on just one instance and scale out on the maximum number of instances are included. \nIt also examines if the client instances are provided with the ip addresses of the new server instances, so that they are able to connect to them. \nTo see detailed information about which scaling functions are executed exactly please refer to the \nscenario-scaling.ini\n file in the project.\n\n\nThe tests \nerror-in-configure\n, \nerror-in-instantiate\n, \nerror-in-start\n, \nerror-in-terminate\n each deploy a network service from a NSD which contains a failing script in the particular lifecycle event and tests if the NFVO handles it correctly. \n\n\nThe test \nwrong-lifecycle-event\n tries to onboard a NSD to the NFVO which contains an undefined lifecycle event. The test will pass if the onboarding is not successful. \n\n\nThe \nuser-project-test\n checks if the NFVO handles user and project management correctly. It adds and deletes users, projects and a vim instance from different \nuser perspectives. This test can be executed without a VNFManager. \n\n\nThe \nstress-test\n checks if the NFVO can handle a large number of NSR deployments from the same or different NSDs at the same time. This test uses the Dummy-VNFM. For this test you should set the property \nnfvo.vmanager.executor.maxpoolsize\n to a large number (e.g. 200) in the /etc/openbaton/openbaton.properties file.\n\n\nIn most of the tests a vim instance and a network service descriptor are stored on the orchestrator and the network service launched. \nIf that is successful, the network service is stopped and the network service record, network service descriptor and the vim instance are removed. \nIn the cases of the \nscenario-real-iperf\n, \nscenario-complex-ncat\n and \nscenario-scaling\n test also the service itself is tested, i.e. if iperf is running and the clients can connect to the server.

Change \nnfvo.delete.vnfr.wait\n to \ntrue\n in \n/etc/openbaton/openbaton.properties\n before starting the NFVO.\n\n\nThen use a shell to navigate into the project's root directory. \nExecute the command \n./integration-tests.sh compile\n.\n\n\nStart the integration test\n\n\nBefore starting the integration tests be sure that the NFVO, Generic VNFM and Dummy VNFM you want to use are already running. \nThen start the test by executing \n./integration-tests.sh start\n.\nIt is possible to specify the test scenarios you want to run so that not every test in the \n/src/main/resources/integration-test-scenarios\n folder is executed. \nTherefore use additional command line arguments while starting the integration tests. Every scenario occuring as an argument will be executed. For example \n./integration-tests.sh start scenario-real-iperf.ini scenario-scaling.ini\n will just execute the tests described in the files \nscenario-real-iperf.ini\n and \nscenario-scaling.ini\n located in the folder \n/src/main/resources/integration-test-scenarios\n.\nIf you do not pass any command line arguments, every available scenario will be executed. To see which scenarios are available execute \n./integration-tests.sh list\n.\n\n\nTest results\n\n\nWhile the tests are running they will produce output to the console. This output will be logged in the file integration-test.log which is in the project's root directory. \nIf a test finished it will either tell you that it passed successfully or not. \nIf it did not pass correctly you will find the reason in the log output. \n\n\nWrite your own integration tests\n\n\nPlease refer to \nthis page\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      // Creating custom :external selector\n      $.expr[':'].external = function(obj){\n          return !obj.href.match(/^mailto\\:/)\n                  && (obj.hostname != location.hostname);\n      };\n      $(function(){\n        $('a:external').addClass('external');\n        $(\".external\").attr('target','_blank');\n      })",

You can list the groups with the command:\n\n\naws ec2 describe-security-groups --output table\n\n\n\n\nYou can also filter the groups by using the Vpc ID like this:\n\n\naws ec2 describe-security-groups --filters Name=vpc-id,Values=\nyour VPC ID\n --output table\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n|                                   DescribeSecurityGroups                                   |\n+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n||                                      SecurityGroups                                      ||\n|+-----------------------------+--------------+------------+---------------+----------------+|\n||         Description         |   GroupId    | GroupName  |    OwnerId    |     VpcId      ||\n|+-----------------------------+--------------+------------+---------------+----------------+|\n||  default VPC security group |  sg-d337e4b9 |  default   |  _-----------|| -------------  ||\n|+-----------------------------+--------------+------------+---------------+----------------+|\n|||                                      IpPermissions                                     |||\n||+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+||\n|||                                       IpProtocol                                       |||\n||+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+||\n|||  -1                                                                                    |||\n||+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+||\n||||                                   UserIdGroupPairs                                   ||||\n|||+-----------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------+|||\n||||                 GroupId                 |                  UserId                    ||||\n|||+-----------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------+|||\n||||  -----------                            |  894307506440                              ||||\n|||+-----------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------+|||\n|||                                   IpPermissionsEgress                                  |||\n||+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+||\n|||                                       IpProtocol                                       |||\n||+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+||\n|||  -1                                                                                    |||\n||+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+||\n||||                                       IpRanges                                       ||||\n|||+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+|||\n||||                                        CidrIp                                        ||||\n|||+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+|||\n||||  0.0.0.0/0                                                                           ||||\n|||+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+|||\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can create a new group by using the command:\n\n\naws create-security-group --group-name \nname\n --description \ndescription\n \n#Which will return group id that can be used to modify the group\n{\n    \nGroupId\n: \n-----\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can use the ID of the group to set the correct permissions and open the correct ports for your services. For example:\n\n\naws ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress --group-name \ngroup-name\n --protocol tcp --port 22 --cidr 0.0.0.0/0\n\n\n\n\nwill enable inbound SSH traffic. You will need it to SSH into the instances. For more information about security group create and customisation you can visit following documentation pages: \ncreating\n, \ntraffic rules\n and \ndescription\n of the security groups.\n\n\nNow you can create key-pair in order to SSH inside the created instances. You can do it by issuing the following command\n\n\n#Create a key and write the data to file\naws ec2 create-key-pair --key-name aws-key --query 'KeyMaterial' --output text \n aws-key.pem\n#Set the proper permissions if on Linux\nchmod 400 aws-key.pem\n\n\n\n\nUse:\n\n\naws ec2 describe-key-pairs\n\n\n\n\nto view the create keys and their fingerprint.\n\n\nOnly in case you are using the generic VNFM and generic EMS you will need a RabbitMQ instance reachable from the VNF instances\n\n\nOne of the solutions is to create an instance inside AWS because it will have a public ip. For this we recommend to create an instance on Ubuntu 14 or 16. and  t2.micro type. \nDue to the very high number of images on AWS marketplace it is not advised to attept describe-image command in order to find a suitable image for rabbitmq instance, we recommend using the command\n\n\naws ec2 describe-images --filters

You can do it via creating tags with a command like this  aws ec2 create-tags --resource  VpcId from the table  --tags Key=Name,Value= your VPC name, will be used as tenant name in PoP description   For more information about the customization of VPCs during creation and by using tags, please, visit the official documentation for  create-vpc command  and  create-tags command .  Create a security group and use the default one. You can list the groups with the command:  aws ec2 describe-security-groups --output table  You can also filter the groups by using the Vpc ID like this:  aws ec2 describe-security-groups --filters Name=vpc-id,Values= your VPC ID  --output table\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n|                                   DescribeSecurityGroups                                   |\n+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n||                                      SecurityGroups                                      ||\n|+-----------------------------+--------------+------------+---------------+----------------+|\n||         Description         |   GroupId    | GroupName  |    OwnerId    |     VpcId      ||\n|+-----------------------------+--------------+------------+---------------+----------------+|\n||  default VPC security group |  sg-d337e4b9 |  default   |  _-----------|| -------------  ||\n|+-----------------------------+--------------+------------+---------------+----------------+|\n|||                                      IpPermissions                                     |||\n||+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+||\n|||                                       IpProtocol                                       |||\n||+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+||\n|||  -1                                                                                    |||\n||+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+||\n||||                                   UserIdGroupPairs                                   ||||\n|||+-----------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------+|||\n||||                 GroupId                 |                  UserId                    ||||\n|||+-----------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------+|||\n||||  -----------                            |  894307506440                              ||||\n|||+-----------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------+|||\n|||                                   IpPermissionsEgress                                  |||\n||+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+||\n|||                                       IpProtocol                                       |||\n||+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+||\n|||  -1                                                                                    |||\n||+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+||\n||||                                       IpRanges                                       ||||\n|||+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+|||\n||||                                        CidrIp                                        ||||\n|||+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+|||\n||||  0.0.0.0/0                                                                           ||||\n|||+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+|||  You can create a new group by using the command:  aws create-security-group --group-name  name  --description  description  \n#Which will return group id that can be used to modify the group\n{\n     GroupId :  ----- \n}  You can use the ID of the group to set the correct permissions and open the correct ports for your services. For example:  aws ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress --group-name  group-name  --protocol tcp --port 22 --cidr 0.0.0.0/0  will enable inbound SSH traffic. You will need it to SSH into the instances. For more information about security group create and customisation you can visit following documentation pages:  creating ,  traffic rules  and  description  of the security groups.  Now you can create key-pair in order to SSH inside the created instances. You can do it by issuing the following command  #Create a key and write the data to file\naws ec2 create-key-pair --key-name aws-key --query 'KeyMaterial' --output text   aws-key.pem\n#Set the proper permissions if on Linux\nchmod 400 aws-key.pem  Use:  aws ec2 describe-key-pairs  to view the create keys and their fingerprint.  Only in case you are using the generic VNFM and generic EMS you will need a RabbitMQ instance reachable from the VNF instances  One of the solutions is to create an instance inside AWS because it will have a public ip. For this we recommend to create an instance on Ubuntu 14 or 16. and  t2.micro type. \nDue to the very high number of images on AWS marketplace it is not advised to attept describe-image command in order to find a suitable image for rabbitmq instance, we recommend using the command  aws ec2 describe-images --filters Name=name,Values=ubuntu/images/hvm-ssd/ubuntu-xenial-16.04-amd64-server-20170721

            "text": "Write your own integration tests\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nIn this site we will describe how to write test cases for the integration tests. \nThe test scenarios are defined in .ini files which are in the directory \nintegration-tests/src/main/resources/integration-test-scenarios\n. If you want to add an integration test, just add its ini file to this folder. \n\n\nIni file structure\n\n\nIn the ini file you can describe a graph or tree like execution plan of different tasks. \nAs an example we will implement the test which is found in the \nscenario-real-iperf.ini\n file step by step. \nFirst we need a base node and define the maximum time of the integration test and the maximum number of concurrent successors. \n\n\n[it]\n;set the maximum time (in seconds) of the Integration test. e.g. 10 min = 600 seconds\nmax-integration-test-time = 800\n;set the maximum number of concurrent successors (max number of active child threads)\nmax-concurrent-successors = 10\n\n\n\n\nAfter that the first step is to store a vim instance to the orchestrator. \n\n\n[it]\n;set the maximum time (in seconds) of the Integration test. e.g. 10 min = 600 seconds\nmax-integration-test-time = 800\n;set the maximum number of concurrent successors (max number of active child threads)\nmax-concurrent-successors = 10\n\n;vimInstance-create\n[it/vim-c-1]\nclass-name = VimInstanceCreate\nname-file = real-vim.json\n\n\n\n\nThe node we just added will create a vim instance. That is defined by the class-name field. \nThe class VimInstanceCreate stores a vim instance from the \nreal-vim.json\n file to the orchestrator. \nA complete list of classes you can use is provided later in this document. \nThe file \nreal-vim.json\n has to be stored either in \n/etc/openbaton/integration-tests/vim-instances/real-vim.json\n or in \n.../integration-tests/src/main/resources/etc/json_file/vim_instances/real-vim.json\n. \nThe file in the first folder has a higher priority than the one in the second one.\n\n\nWe already know that we want to delete this vim from the orchestrator at the end of the test. \nSo we can add the following:\n\n\n[it]\n;set the maximum time (in seconds) of the Integration test. e.g. 10 min = 600 seconds\nmax-integration-test-time = 800\n;set the maximum number of concurrent successors (max number of active child threads)\nmax-concurrent-successors = 10\n\n;vimInstance-create\n[it/vim-c-1]\nclass-name = VimInstanceCreate\nname-file = real-vim.json\nsuccessor-remover = vim-d-1\n\n[it/vim-c-1/vim-d-1]\nclass-name = VimInstanceDelete\n\n\n\n\nThe successor-remover field specifies, that the node \nvim-d-1\n will be executed after every child node/task of \nvim-c-1\n has finished. \nEvery node can only have one successor-remover. \nThe new node gets the information which vim instance it should delete passed from the first node. \n\n\nThe next step will be to create and delete a network service descriptor (NSD). \n\n\n[it]\n;set the maximum time (in seconds) of the Integration test. e.g. 10 min = 600 seconds\nmax-integration-test-time = 800\n;set the maximum number of concurrent successors (max number of active child threads)\nmax-concurrent-successors = 10\n\n;vimInstance-create\n[it/vim-c-1]\nclass-name = VimInstanceCreate\nname-file = real-vim.json\nsuccessor-remover = vim-d-1\n\n[it/vim-c-1/vim-d-1]\nclass-name = VimInstanceDelete\n\n;nsd-create\n[it/vim-c-1/nsd-c-1]\nclass-name = NetworkServiceDescriptorCreate\nnum_instances = 1\nsuccessor-remover = nsd-d-1\nname-file = NetworkServiceDescriptor-iperf-real.json\n\n;nsd-delete\n[it/vim-c-1/nsd-c-1/nsd-d-1]\nclass-name = NetworkServiceDescriptorDelete\n\n\n\n\nHere the new nodes are \nnsd-c-1\n and \nnsd-d-1\n. \n\nnsd-d-1\n is the successor remover of \nnsd-c-1\n and will be executed if every child node/task from \nnsd-c-1\n finished. \n\nnsd-c-1\n has some fields that need explanation. \nnum_instances\n specifies how many of those tasks should be created. \nAt the moment there is just one so only one NSD will be stored on the orchestrator. \nBut if we would provide for example a 2, then this task would be executed twice concurrently. \nEvery task would be independent and every child node which is defined for \nnsd-c-1\n would be executed for every instance separately. \nThe name-file specifies the .json file that shall be used to create the NSD. \nIt may be stored either in \n/etc/openbaton/integration-tests/network-service-descriptors/NetworkServiceDescriptor-iperf-real.json\n or in \n.../integration-tests/src/main/resources/etc/json_file/network_service_descriptors/NetworkServiceDescriptor-iperf-real.json\n. \nAgain the former folder has a higher priority than the latter one. \n\n\nIn the next step we will deploy the network service record (NSR) from the created NSDs and wait for its instantiation. \n\n\n[it]\n;set the maximum time (in seconds) of the Integration test. e.g. 10 min = 600 seconds\nmax-integration-test-time = 800\n;set the maximum number of concurrent successors (max number of active child threads)\nmax-concurrent-successors = 10\n\n;vimInstance-create\n[it/vim-c-1]\nclass-name = VimInstanceCreate\nname-file = real-vim.json\nsuccessor-remover = vim-d-1\n\n[it/vim-c-1/vim-d-1]\nclass-name = VimInstanceDelete\n\n;nsd-create\n[it/vim-c-1/nsd-c-1]\nclass-name = NetworkServiceDescriptorCreate\nnum_instances = 1\nsuccessor-remover = nsd-d-1\nname-file = NetworkServiceDescriptor-iperf-real.json\n\n;nsd-delete\n[it/vim-c-1/nsd-c-1/nsd-d-1]\nclass-name = NetworkServiceDescriptorDelete\n\n;nsr-create\n[it/vim-c-1/nsd-c-1/nsr-c-1]\nclass-name = NetworkServiceRecordCreate\nnum_instances = 1\n\n;nsr-wait for creation\n[it/vim-c-1/nsd-c-1/nsr-c-1/nsr-w-1]\nclass-name = NetworkServiceRecordWait\n;the default timeout is 5 seconds\ntimeout = 600\naction = INSTANTIATE_FINISH\n\n\n\n\nnsr-c-1\n works similar to the creation of a NSD. It gets its information which NSD it should use from the preceiding task, so it has to be the NSD creation node. \nThe interesting part in this step is the \nnsr-w-1\n node. \nThis waits for the orchestrator to send the action INSTANTIATE_FINISH. If it receives it, the task was successful and the integration test proceeds. \n\n\nNow we will show how to test, if the network service is actually running.\nTherefore you can tell the integration test to ssh the instantiated virtual machines and execute commands.\nThose commands have to be written in scripts which can be placed in two locations.\nEither in \n/etc/openbaton/integration-tests/scripts/\n or in \n/integration-tests/src/main/resources/etc/scripts/\n in the\nproject itself. The former directory is checked first for a script name. If it does not exist there the latter location is used. \nBash sources the scripts on the remote machines. \nBut where do I specify the Virtual Machines on which the scripts shall be executed? Well, also in the .ini file.\nUse the \nGenericServiceTester\n.\n\n\n[it]\n;set the maximum time (in seconds) of the Integration test. e.g. 10 min = 600 seconds\nmax-integration-test-time = 800\n;set the maximum number of concurrent successors (max number of active child threads)\nmax-concurrent-successors = 10\n\n;vimInstance-create\n[it/vim-c-1]\nclass-name = VimInstanceCreate\nname-file = real-vim.json\nsuccessor-remover = vim-d-1\n\n[it/vim-c-1/vim-d-1]\nclass-name = VimInstanceDelete\n\n;nsd-create\n[it/vim-c-1/nsd-c-1]\nclass-name = NetworkServiceDescriptorCreate\nnum_instances = 1\nsuccessor-remover = nsd-d-1\nname-file = NetworkServiceDescriptor-iperf-real.json\n\n;nsd-delete\n[it/vim-c-1/nsd-c-1/nsd-d-1]\nclass-name = NetworkServiceDescriptorDelete\n\n;nsr-create\n[it/vim-c-1/nsd-c-1/nsr-c-1]\nclass-name = NetworkServiceRecordCreate\nnum_instances = 1\n\n;nsr-wait for creation\n[it/vim-c-1/nsd-c-1/nsr-c-1/nsr-w-1]\nclass-name = NetworkServiceRecordWait\n;the default timeout is 5 seconds\ntimeout = 600\naction = INSTANTIATE_FINISH\n\n[it/vim-c-1/nsd-c-1/nsr-c-1/nsr-w-1/gst-1]\nclass-name = GenericServiceTester\nvnf-type = client\nuser-name = ubuntu\nvm-scripts-path = /home/ubuntu\nscript-1 = iperf-running.sh\nscript-2 = iperf-clt-connection.sh\n\n\n\n\nThe class name specifies, that we want to use the GenericServiceTester to test our service.\nThe vnf-type is used to say on which virtual network functions the scripts should be executed and is equal to the one you wrote into the network service descriptor.\nIn our example the integration test would execute them on a virtual machine, which runs the iperfserver VNF which has the type 'server'. \nIn user-name you have to specify the user name of the virtual machine, so that the integration test can ssh into the machine. \nAnd vm-scripts-path declares the directory in which the testing scripts should be stored on the virtual machine. Keep in mind that this directory has to already exist, it will not be created by the integration test. \nAnd finally you have to specify the script name. script-1 will be the first script executed in that task.\nIf you want to execute more than that, just add script-2, script-3 and so on.\n\n\nHere is the script \niperf-running.sh\n used to see if iperf is running:\n\n\n#!/bin/bash\n\niperf_count=`exec ps -aux | grep -v grep | grep iperf | wc -l`\nif [ $iperf_count -lt 1 ]\nthen\n  exit 1\nelse\n  exit 0\nfi\n\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see the script exits with status 0 on success and otherwise on 1 like usual. \nEvery script you write for the integration test should exit on a value not 0 if they fail. \nThe integration test will just pass if all the scripts exit on 0.\n\n\nSo, now we know that iperf is running on the client virtual machine. But are the client and server really communicating at the moment?\nTo test that we added another script \niperf-clt-connection.sh\n to the client task, that checks if there is an outgoing or incoming connection related to iperf and exits successfully if one exists. Here's the script:\n\n\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# this will return the ip of the remote partner of the communication, here the iperf-server\noutgoing=`sudo netstat -npt | grep iperf | awk '{print $5}' | sed 's/:.*//'` \n\n# check if the communication partner is really the iperf-server\nif [ $outgoing == ${server_ip} ]\nthen\n  exit 0\nelse\n  exit 1\nfi\n\n\n\n\n(You may wonder where '${server_ip}' comes from. It is a variable provided by the integration test as explained later. \nWe use sudo for the netstat command, because the iperf command was started by the root user.)\n\n\nWe now also add a node in the ini file for the server. \n\n\n[it]\n;set the maximum time (in seconds) of the Integration test. e.g. 10 min = 600 seconds\nmax-integration-test-time = 800\n;set the maximum number of concurrent successors (max number of active child threads)\nmax-concurrent-successors = 10\n\n;vimInstance-create\n[it/vim-c-1]\nclass-name = VimInstanceCreate\nname-file = real-vim.json\nsuccessor-remover = vim-d-1\n\n[it/vim-c-1/vim-d-1]\nclass-name = VimInstanceDelete\n\n;nsd-create\n[it/vim-c-1/nsd-c-1]\nclass-name = NetworkServiceDescriptorCreate\nnum_instances = 1\nsuccessor-remover = nsd-d-1\nname-file = NetworkServiceDescriptor-iperf-real.json\n\n;nsd-delete\n[it/vim-c-1/nsd-c-1/nsd-d-1]\nclass-name = NetworkServiceDescriptorDelete\n\n;nsr-create\n[it/vim-c-1/nsd-c-1/nsr-c-1]\nclass-name = NetworkServiceRecordCreate\nnum_instances = 1\n\n;nsr-wait for creation\n[it/vim-c-1/nsd-c-1/nsr-c-1/nsr-w-1]\nclass-name = NetworkServiceRecordWait\n;the default timeout is 5 seconds\ntimeout = 600\naction = INSTANTIATE_FINISH\n\n[it/vim-c-1/nsd-c-1/nsr-c-1/nsr-w-1/gst-1]\nclass-name = GenericServiceTester\nvnf-type = client\nuser-name = ubuntu\nvm-scripts-path = /home/ubuntu\nscript-1 = iperf-running.sh\nscript-2 = iperf-clt-connection.sh\n\n\n[it/vim-c-1/nsd-c-1/nsr-c-1/nsr-w-1/gst-1/gst-2]\nclass-name = GenericServiceTester\nvnf-type = server\nnet-name = private\nuser-name = ubuntu\nvm-scripts-path = /home/ubuntu\nscript-1 = iperf-running.sh\nscript-2 = iperf-srv-connection.sh\n\n\n\n\nThe second script for the server task looks like this:\n\n\n#!/bin/bash\n\n\nincoming=`sudo netstat -npt | grep iperf | wc -l`\n\nif [ $incoming -eq 0 ] \nthen\n  exit 1\nelse\n  exit 0\nfi\n\n\n\n\nHere we just count if there are incoming connections to the server. \n\n\nAfter the iperf-running.sh script, the iperf-srv-connection.sh script will be executed on the server virtual machines \nand on the client one's also iperf-running.sh and then the script iperf-clt-conection.sh.\n\n\nNow imagine, that you did not specify one virtual network function component in the client's NSD, but five. And you want to test them all.\nDo you have to create five tasks for that? No, if you define the task for the client as shown above, the integration test will execute\nthe scripts on every virtual machine, that was deployed by the vnfd with the type \nclient\n.\n\n\nAnd if you have some virtual network function components connected to two different networks but just want to test the ones connected\nto one of them, you can add a \nnet-name\n field to the task and just the ones connected to it will be involved like in the server task.\n\n\nAfterwards we want to delete the NSDs and simutaniously wait for a message from the orchestrator, that the deletion finished. \n\n\n[it]\n;set the maximum time (in seconds) of the Integration test. e.g. 10 min = 600 seconds\nmax-integration-test-time = 800\n;set the maximum number of concurrent successors (max number of active child threads)\nmax-concurrent-successors = 10\n\n;vimInstance-create\n[it/vim-c-1]\nclass-name = VimInstanceCreate\nname-file = real-vim.json\nsuccessor-remover = vim-d-1\n\n[it/vim-c-1/vim-d-1]\nclass-name = VimInstanceDelete\n\n;nsd-create\n[it/vim-c-1/nsd-c-1]\nclass-name = NetworkServiceDescriptorCreate\nnum_instances = 1\nsuccessor-remover = nsd-d-1\nname-file = NetworkServiceDescriptor-iperf-real.json\n\n;nsd-delete\n[it/vim-c-1/nsd-c-1/nsd-d-1]\nclass-name = NetworkServiceDescriptorDelete\n\n;nsr-create\n[it/vim-c-1/nsd-c-1/nsr-c-1]\nclass-name = NetworkServiceRecordCreate\nnum_instances = 1\n\n;nsr-wait for creation\n[it/vim-c-1/nsd-c-1/nsr-c-1/nsr-w-1]\nclass-name = NetworkServiceRecordWait\n;the default timeout is 5 seconds\ntimeout = 600\naction = INSTANTIATE_FINISH\n\n[it/vim-c-1/nsd-c-1/nsr-c-1/nsr-w-1/gst-1]\nclass-name = GenericServiceTester\nvnf-type = client\nuser-name = ubuntu\nvm-scripts-path = /home/ubuntu\nscript-1 = iperf-running.sh\nscript-2 = iperf-clt-connection.sh\n\n\n[it/vim-c-1/nsd-c-1/nsr-c-1/nsr-w-1/gst-1/gst-2]\nclass-name = GenericServiceTester\nvnf-type = server\nnet-name = private\nuser-name = ubuntu\nvm-scripts-path = /home/ubuntu\nscript-1 = iperf-running.sh\nscript-2 = iperf-srv-connection.sh\n\n;nsr-wait for deletion\n[it/vim-c-1/nsd-c-1/nsr-c-1/nsr-w-1/gst-1/gst-2/nsr-w-2]\nclass-name = NetworkServiceRecordWait\n;the default timeout is 5 seconds\ntimeout = 360\naction = RELEASE_RESOURCES_FINISH\n\n;nsr-delete\n[it/vim-c-1/nsd-c-1/nsr-c-1/nsr-w-1/gst-1/gst-2/nsr-d-1]\nclass-name = NetworkServiceRecordDelete\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see the nodes \nnsr-w-2\n and \nnsr-d-1\n are both child nodes of \ngst-2\n. \nThis means that they are executed concurrently. \nThe \nnsr-w-2\n node waits for the action RELEASE_RESOURCES_FINISH sent by the NFVO and finishes successfully if it receives it. \n\n\nNow are all the child nodes of \nnsd-c-1\n finished and its successor remover nsd-d-1 will be executed which deletes the stored NSDs. \nAfter that all the child nodes of \nvim-c-1\n finished and its successor remover \nvim-d-1\n starts to delete the stored vim instance. \n\n\nA little more on scripts\n\n\nNow we come back to the '${server_ip}' variable in the iperf-clt-connection script. As mentioned earlier this variable is provided \nby the integration test. It stores the ip of the server. If you wanted to access the IPs of the clients, you could use ${client_ip}. \nThe problem is, that we could for example also have two or more instances of clients. Which ip is chosen? \nActually the script, which contains this variable will be executed twice or more on the virtual machine until every possible substitution was handled. \nYou have access to the IPs, floating IPs and configurations. \nYou can access ips by writing ${vnfrtype_ip} or ${vnfrtype_network_ip} (don't forget the braces). The 'vnfrtype' in our example would be 'server' or 'client'. \nThe 'network' is the virtual_link you specified in the VNFD for the VNF Component and will only retrieve the VNFC ips which are connected to this network. \nIf you have more than one VNFC Instance which is deployed, so for example you have two iperf-servers \ndeployed from one VNFD, then there would be two possibilities to substitute ${server_ip}. If you want to execute a script on the virtual machine of the \niperf-client which contains this variable the integration test will do the following. Execute the script containing the \nvariable with first the ip of one server. And then executing the same script, but now replacing the variable with the other ip. \nThat way you just have to write one script and all the VNF Components of the VNF will be tested. \nYou can access the floating ips of VNFCs by writing ${vnfrtype_fip} or ${vnfrtype_network_fip}. \nOf course, this will only work if there is a floating ip for that virtual machine. \nThe configurations are accessible by typing ${vnfrtype_configurationkey}. \nFor all the variables it is essential, that you enclose them with braces otherwise they won't work. \n\n\nTask execution order\n\n\nJust to clarify the execution order of the tasks specified in the ini files here is a little example without describing what the tasks do. \nThe successor-removers of a task are just executed when all the other child tasks and their subsequent tasks finished.\n\n\n[it/A]\nsuccessor-remover = H\n\n[it/A/H]\n...\n\n[it/A/B]\n...\n\n[it/A/C]\n...\n\n[it/A/C/D]\nsuccessor-remover = G\n\n[it/A/C/D/G]\n...\n\n[it/A/C/D/E]\n...\n\n[it/A/C/D/F]\n...\n\n\n\n\nThe execution order of this example looks like this:\n\n\n\n\nTasks that are side by side can run concurrently. \n\n\nOther important information\n\n\nFor the integration test to be able to ssh into the virtual machines on OpenStack, you have to import a key pair in OpenStack and assign the public key of the host, on which the integration tests run, to it.\nThe key pair's name has to be contained in the VIM instance used for deployments on OpenStack. \nRemember to make the scripts executable, that are run for testing the actual functionlity of the deployed Network Service.\nDo NOT use '-' in types of VNFDs or configuration names as you cannot use them in bash scripts. \n\n\nThe class-name types available\n\n\nAs mentioned earlier here is a summary of all the class-names available at the moment to use in a ini file node.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nclass-name\n\n\npurpose\n\n\nfields\n\n\nfield purpose\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGenericServiceTester\n\n\nTest the network service itself\n\n\nscript-1\n\n\nThe first script to be executed on the VM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nscript-n\n\n\nThe n-th script to be executed on the VM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nvnf-type\n\n\nThe type of the VNFs that shall be tested\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nuser-name\n\n\nThe user account on the VM on which the scripts will be executed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nvm-scripts-path\n\n\nThe path to the directory of the VM where the scripts will be stored before execution\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnet-name\n\n\nSpecifies the network/virtual-link to which the VMs that shall be tested are connected\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNetworkServiceDescriptorCreate\n\n\nStore a NSD on the NFVO\n\n\nexpected-to-fail\n\n\nIf set to true the task will fail if the onboarding of the NSD is successful\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nname-file\n\n\nThe name of the json file which contains the NSD\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNetworkServiceDescriptorCreateFromPackage\n\n\nCreate a NSD by using a VNFPackage that was uploaded beforehand\n\n\nexpected-to-fail\n\n\nIf set to true the task will fail if the onboarding of the NSD is successful\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nname-file\n\n\nThe name of the json file which contains the NSD\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNetworkServiceDescriptorDelete\n\n\nDelete a NSD from the NFVO\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNetworkServiceDescriptorWait\n\n\nWait for a specific event of the NFVO to happen that is related to NSDs\n\n\naction\n\n\nThe event which will be waited for to happen\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNetworkServiceRecordCreate\n\n\nDeploy a network service from a NSD and create the NSR\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNetworkServiceRecordDelete\n\n\nDelete the NSR\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNetworkServiceRecordGetLatest\n\n\nExpects to get passed a NSR from its preceding task, retrieves the latest version of this NSR from the NFVO and passes it to the following task\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNetworkServiceRecordWait\n\n\nWait for a specific event of the NFVO to happen that is related to NSRs\n\n\naction\n\n\nThe event which will be waited for to happen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntimeout\n\n\nAfter this time (in seconds) the task will fail if the event did not occur yet\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPackageDelete\n\n\nDelete a VNFPackage\n\n\npackage-name\n\n\nThe name of the package that will be deleted\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPackageUpload\n\n\nUpload a VNFPackage\n\n\npackage-upload\n\n\nThe name of the package that will be uploaded\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPause\n\n\nUsed to elapse time until the next task will start\n\n\nduration\n\n\nThe time (in seconds) that this task shall do nothing and after which it will finish\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProjectCreate\n\n\nUsed to create a new Project\n\n\nas-user-name\n\n\nIf specified the integration tests will use this user to create the Project.

Then the package iperf-server-package.tar is stored by specifying the package file name in the package-name attribute. \nThe packages have to be in the directory /etc/openbaton/integration-tests/vnf-packages/. \nAfterwards a NSD is created from the VNFDs in the package and right after that deleted (to keep this example short we did not create a NSR from the NSD and so on). Be aware that you \nhave to use the class NetworkServiceDescriptorCreateFromPackage to store a NSD from a package. \nThen also the package will be deleted. You have to provide the name of the package you want to delete (not the file name this time but the name of the package defined in the Metadata.yaml). \nAt the end the vim instance is deleted. \n\n\nIf you create a NSD from a VNFPackage, the VNFD field of the NSD file would look something like this: \n\n\nvnfd\n:[\n{\n      \ntype\n:\nserver\n\n},\n{\n      \ntype\n:\nclient\n\n}\n\n   ],\n\n\n\n\nThe integration test will search for VNFDs with these types that were previously stored by a VNFPackage and use them for creating the NSD. \n\n\nScaling\n\n\nThere are three testers for Scaling already implemented. The first one is \nScaleOut\n. In the ini file this tester needs some additional attributes. Besides the normal \nclass-name\n you should also specify the VNFR type on which the scale out should be performed in the field \nvnf-type\n. Then you can also specify the virtual-link to which the new instance should be connected using \nvirtual-link\n. \nAnd you can determine a floating ip for the new instance using the field \nfloating-ip\n. \nHere is an example of a ScaleOut task in the ini file:\n\n\n[it/.../sc-o-1]\nclass-name = ScaleOut\nvnf-type = client\nvirtual-link = private\nfloating-ip = random\n\n\n\n\nThe second tester is \nScaleIn\n. Here you can just specify on which VNFR type the scale in should be executed. An example: \n\n\n[it/.../sc-i-1]\nclass-name = ScaleIn\nvnf-type = client\n\n\n\n\nAnd the third tester is used to see if after the scaling operation there is the right number of instances running. \nSpecify the VNFR type you want to test by providing \nvnf-type\n in the ini file and specify the number of expected VNFC instances by using \nvnfc-count\n. For example: \n\n\n[it/.../sc-t-1]\nclass-name = ScalingTester\nvnf-type = client\nvnfc-count = 2\n\n\n\n\nFurthermore note that the ScalingTester passes the updated NSR to the next tester. If you trigger a scaling function the NSR will change, but if you do not use ScalingTester (or NetworkServiceRecordGetLatest) the NSR used by the integration test will remain the old one before the scaling operation. \nSo the recommended proceeding after a scale out or scale in is to wait until the operation finishes and then use the \nScalingTester\n or at least the \nNetworkServiceRecordGetLatest\n to have the updated NSR.",

[it]\n;set the maximum time (in seconds) of the Integration test. e.g. 10 min = 600 seconds\nmax-integration-test-time = 800\n;set the maximum number of concurrent successors (max number of active child threads)\nmax-concurrent-successors = 10  After that the first step is to store a vim instance to the orchestrator.

That is defined by the class-name field. \nThe class VimInstanceCreate stores a vim instance from the  real-vim.json  file to the orchestrator. \nA complete list of classes you can use is provided later in this document. \nThe file  real-vim.json  has to be stored either in  /etc/openbaton/integration-tests/vim-instances/real-vim.json  or in  .../integration-tests/src/main/resources/etc/json_file/vim_instances/real-vim.json . \nThe file in the first folder has a higher priority than the one in the second one.  We already know that we want to delete this vim from the orchestrator at the end of the test. \nSo we can add the following:  [it]\n;set the maximum time (in seconds) of the Integration test. e.g. 10 min = 600 seconds\nmax-integration-test-time = 800\n;set the maximum number of concurrent successors (max number of active child threads)\nmax-concurrent-successors = 10\n\n;vimInstance-create\n[it/vim-c-1]\nclass-name = VimInstanceCreate\nname-file = real-vim.json\nsuccessor-remover = vim-d-1\n\n[it/vim-c-1/vim-d-1]\nclass-name = VimInstanceDelete  The successor-remover field specifies, that the node  vim-d-1  will be executed after every child node/task of  vim-c-1  has finished. \nEvery node can only have one successor-remover. \nThe new node gets the information which vim instance it should delete passed from the first node.   The next step will be to create and delete a network service descriptor (NSD).   [it]\n;set the maximum time (in seconds) of the Integration test. e.g. 10 min = 600 seconds\nmax-integration-test-time = 800\n;set the maximum number of concurrent successors (max number of active child threads)\nmax-concurrent-successors = 10\n\n;vimInstance-create\n[it/vim-c-1]\nclass-name = VimInstanceCreate\nname-file = real-vim.json\nsuccessor-remover = vim-d-1\n\n[it/vim-c-1/vim-d-1]\nclass-name = VimInstanceDelete\n\n;nsd-create\n[it/vim-c-1/nsd-c-1]\nclass-name = NetworkServiceDescriptorCreate\nnum_instances = 1\nsuccessor-remover = nsd-d-1\nname-file = NetworkServiceDescriptor-iperf-real.json\n\n;nsd-delete\n[it/vim-c-1/nsd-c-1/nsd-d-1]\nclass-name = NetworkServiceDescriptorDelete  Here the new nodes are  nsd-c-1  and  nsd-d-1 .  nsd-d-1  is the successor remover of  nsd-c-1  and will be executed if every child node/task from  nsd-c-1  finished.  nsd-c-1  has some fields that need explanation.  num_instances  specifies how many of those tasks should be created. \nAt the moment there is just one so only one NSD will be stored on the orchestrator. \nBut if we would provide for example a 2, then this task would be executed twice concurrently. \nEvery task would be independent and every child node which is defined for  nsd-c-1  would be executed for every instance separately. \nThe name-file specifies the .json file that shall be used to create the NSD. \nIt may be stored either in  /etc/openbaton/integration-tests/network-service-descriptors/NetworkServiceDescriptor-iperf-real.json  or in  .../integration-tests/src/main/resources/etc/json_file/network_service_descriptors/NetworkServiceDescriptor-iperf-real.json . \nAgain the former folder has a higher priority than the latter one.   In the next step we will deploy the network service record (NSR) from the created NSDs and wait for its instantiation.   [it]\n;set the maximum time (in seconds) of the Integration test. e.g. 10 min = 600 seconds\nmax-integration-test-time = 800\n;set the maximum number of concurrent successors (max number of active child threads)\nmax-concurrent-successors = 10\n\n;vimInstance-create\n[it/vim-c-1]\nclass-name = VimInstanceCreate\nname-file = real-vim.json\nsuccessor-remover = vim-d-1\n\n[it/vim-c-1/vim-d-1]\nclass-name = VimInstanceDelete\n\n;nsd-create\n[it/vim-c-1/nsd-c-1]\nclass-name = NetworkServiceDescriptorCreate\nnum_instances = 1\nsuccessor-remover = nsd-d-1\nname-file = NetworkServiceDescriptor-iperf-real.json\n\n;nsd-delete\n[it/vim-c-1/nsd-c-1/nsd-d-1]\nclass-name = NetworkServiceDescriptorDelete\n\n;nsr-create\n[it/vim-c-1/nsd-c-1/nsr-c-1]\nclass-name = NetworkServiceRecordCreate\nnum_instances = 1\n\n;nsr-wait for creation\n[it/vim-c-1/nsd-c-1/nsr-c-1/nsr-w-1]\nclass-name = NetworkServiceRecordWait\n;the default timeout is 5 seconds\ntimeout = 600\naction = INSTANTIATE_FINISH  nsr-c-1  works similar to the creation of a NSD. It gets its information which NSD it should use from the preceiding task, so it has to be the NSD creation node. \nThe interesting part in this step is the  nsr-w-1  node. \nThis waits for the orchestrator to send the action INSTANTIATE_FINISH. If it receives it, the task was successful and the integration test proceeds.   Now we will show how to test, if the network service is actually running.\nTherefore you can tell the integration test to ssh the instantiated virtual machines and execute commands.\nThose commands have to be written in scripts which can be placed in two locations.\nEither in  /etc/openbaton/integration-tests/scripts/  or in  /integration-tests/src/main/resources/etc/scripts/  in the\nproject itself. The former directory is checked first for a script name. If it does not exist there the latter location is used. \nBash sources the scripts on the remote machines. \nBut where do I specify the Virtual Machines on which the scripts shall be executed? Well, also in the .ini file.\nUse the  GenericServiceTester .  [it]\n;set the maximum time (in seconds) of the Integration test. e.g. 10 min = 600 seconds\nmax-integration-test-time = 800\n;set the maximum number of concurrent successors (max number of active child threads)\nmax-concurrent-successors = 10\n\n;vimInstance-create\n[it/vim-c-1]\nclass-name = VimInstanceCreate\nname-file = real-vim.json\nsuccessor-remover = vim-d-1\n\n[it/vim-c-1/vim-d-1]\nclass-name = VimInstanceDelete\n\n;nsd-create\n[it/vim-c-1/nsd-c-1]\nclass-name = NetworkServiceDescriptorCreate\nnum_instances = 1\nsuccessor-remover = nsd-d-1\nname-file = NetworkServiceDescriptor-iperf-real.json\n\n;nsd-delete\n[it/vim-c-1/nsd-c-1/nsd-d-1]\nclass-name = NetworkServiceDescriptorDelete\n\n;nsr-create\n[it/vim-c-1/nsd-c-1/nsr-c-1]\nclass-name = NetworkServiceRecordCreate\nnum_instances = 1\n\n;nsr-wait for creation\n[it/vim-c-1/nsd-c-1/nsr-c-1/nsr-w-1]\nclass-name = NetworkServiceRecordWait\n;the default timeout is 5 seconds\ntimeout = 600\naction = INSTANTIATE_FINISH\n\n[it/vim-c-1/nsd-c-1/nsr-c-1/nsr-w-1/gst-1]\nclass-name = GenericServiceTester\nvnf-type = client\nuser-name = ubuntu\nvm-scripts-path = /home/ubuntu\nscript-1 = iperf-running.sh\nscript-2 = iperf-clt-connection.sh  The class name specifies, that we want to use the GenericServiceTester to test our service.\nThe vnf-type is used to say on which virtual network functions the scripts should be executed and is equal to the one you wrote into the network service descriptor.\nIn our example the integration test would execute them on a virtual machine, which runs the iperfserver VNF which has the type 'server'. \nIn user-name you have to specify the user name of the virtual machine, so that the integration test can ssh into the machine. \nAnd vm-scripts-path declares the directory in which the testing scripts should be stored on the virtual machine. Keep in mind that this directory has to already exist, it will not be created by the integration test. \nAnd finally you have to specify the script name. script-1 will be the first script executed in that task.\nIf you want to execute more than that, just add script-2, script-3 and so on.  Here is the script  iperf-running.sh  used to see if iperf is running:  #!/bin/bash\n\niperf_count=`exec ps -aux | grep -v grep | grep iperf | wc -l`\nif [ $iperf_count -lt 1 ]\nthen\n  exit 1\nelse\n  exit 0\nfi  As you can see the script exits with status 0 on success and otherwise on 1 like usual. \nEvery script you write for the integration test should exit on a value not 0 if they fail. \nThe integration test will just pass if all the scripts exit on 0.  So, now we know that iperf is running on the client virtual machine. But are the client and server really communicating at the moment?\nTo test that we added another script  iperf-clt-connection.sh  to the client task, that checks if there is an outgoing or incoming connection related to iperf and exits successfully if one exists. Here's the script:  #!/bin/bash\n\n# this will return the ip of the remote partner of the communication, here the iperf-server\noutgoing=`sudo netstat -npt | grep iperf | awk '{print $5}' | sed 's/:.*//'` \n\n# check if the communication partner is really the iperf-server\nif [ $outgoing == ${server_ip} ]\nthen\n  exit 0\nelse\n  exit 1\nfi  (You may wonder where '${server_ip}' comes from. It is a variable provided by the integration test as explained later. \nWe use sudo for the netstat command, because the iperf command was started by the root user.)  We now also add a node in the ini file for the server.

After the iperf-running.sh script, the iperf-srv-connection.sh script will be executed on the server virtual machines \nand on the client one's also iperf-running.sh and then the script iperf-clt-conection.sh.  Now imagine, that you did not specify one virtual network function component in the client's NSD, but five. And you want to test them all.\nDo you have to create five tasks for that? No, if you define the task for the client as shown above, the integration test will execute\nthe scripts on every virtual machine, that was deployed by the vnfd with the type  client .  And if you have some virtual network function components connected to two different networks but just want to test the ones connected\nto one of them, you can add a  net-name  field to the task and just the ones connected to it will be involved like in the server task.  Afterwards we want to delete the NSDs and simutaniously wait for a message from the orchestrator, that the deletion finished.

For more details about the NFVO architecture, you can refer to the next sections\n\n\nTest VIM Driver for being able to execute the \nhello world\n tutorial without needing an OpenStack instance.\n\n\nRabbitMQ\n as messaging system\n\n\n\n\nA complete version includes those additional components:\n\n\n\n\nOpenStack VIM Driver for deploying VNFs on OpenStack\n\n\nGeneric VNFM for the instantiation of VNFs part of the Open Baton ecosystem\n\n\nFault Management System for the support to detection and recovery of VNF faults\n\n\nAuto Scaling Engine for the automatic creation and termination of VNF instances due to performance requirements\n\n\nNetwork Slicing Engine for ensuring a specific QoS for your NS\n\n\nMySQL\n as a mean to enable the persistence when using Open Baton\n\n\n\n\nRequirements\n\n\nTo facilitate the installation procedures we provide a bootstrap script which will install the desired components and configure them for running a \nhello world\n VNF out of the box. To execute the bootstrap procedure you need to have curl installed (see http://curl.haxx.se/). This command should work on any linux system:\n\n\napt-get install curl\n\n\n\n\nNOTE\n - We assume that you are performing the installation on top of a clean installation of \nUbuntu 16.04\n. To install Open Baton either on \nUbuntu 14.04\n or \nDebian Jessy\n you need first to manually install the JDK 8. In other cases we suggest to install the components one by one. You can checkout the \nbootstrap\n repository and see the installation procedures which are executed by the bootstrap script.\n\n\nOpen Baton can be installed on any kind of environment (physical hosts, virtual machines, containers, etc.). Suggested requirements in terms of CPUs, Memory, and disk space are: \n\n\n\n\nminimal version: \n 2GB of RAM, and \n 2CPUs, 10GB of disk space\n\n\ncomplete version: \n 8GB of RAM, and \n 8CPUs, 10GB of disk space\n\n\n\n\nIn general, you may be able to get a working environment also with less perfomant hardware, especially tuning the JVM startup options (i.e -Xms and -Xmx).\n\n\nInstallation guide\n\n\nTo start the bootstrap procedure of the \ndevelopment\n Open Baton environment you can type the following command:\n\n\nsh \n(curl -s http://get.openbaton.org/bootstrap) develop\n\n\n\n\nAlternatively, you can have a non-interactive installation using a configuration file. Specifically, you need to have the configuration file locally available and to pass it to the bootstrap command as a parameter.\nYou can download this example of \nconfiguration file\n, modify it accordingly and execute the bootstrap typing the following command:\n\n\nsh \n(curl -s http://get.openbaton.org/bootstrap) develop --config-file=\nabsolute path to your configuration file\n\n\n\n\n\nNOTE\n - If you need support, get in contact with us at: \ninfo@openbaton.org\n\n\nVERY IMPORTANT NOTE\n - By default RabbitMQ is installed on the host of the NFVO. Be aware of the fact that during the installation you will be prompted for entering the RabbitMQ IP and Port. Please make sure that this IP can be\n  reached by external components (VMs, or host where will run other VNFMs) otherwise you will have runtime issues. If you are installing Open Baton on a VM running in OpenStack, the best is that you put here\n  the floating IP.\n\n\nDuring the bootstrap procedure you will be prompted for inputs. For instance you can choose to install or not the Generic VNFM as well as other additional components, or enable or not SSL.\nFor each additional component, you can choose if install a specific TAG of a component or if install the \"develop\" version of the source code (the default).\nAt the end of the bootstrap procedure, if there are no errors, the dashboard should be reachable at: \nlocalhost:8080\n.\nDepending on which additional component you decided to add to the Open Baton installation then you should have the following structure:\n\n\n/opt/openbaton/\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 nfvo\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 generic-vnfm\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 fm-system\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 autoscaling\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 nse\n\n\n\n\nWhere:\n\n\n\n\nnfvo\n contains the source code and scripts of the NFVO\n\n\ngeneric-vnfm\n contains the source code and scripts required for dealing with the Generic VNFM\n\n\nfm-system\n contains the source code and scripts required for dealing with the Fault Management System (FMS)\n\n\nautoscaling\n contains the source code and scripts required for dealing with the Auto Scaling Engine (ASE)\n\n\nnse\n contains the source code and scripts required for dealing with the Network Slicing Engine (NSE)\n\n\n\n\nAt this point the NFVO is ready to be used. Please refer to the \nIntroduction\n on how to start using it or step into the \nhello world\n tutorial immediately.\n\n\nStarting and stopping the NFVO\n\n\nAfter the installation procedure the NFVO is running. If you want to stop it, enter this command:\n\n\ncd /opt/openbaton/nfvo\n./openbaton.sh stop\n\n\n\n\nTo start the nfvo, enter the command:\n\n\ncd /opt/openbaton/nfvo\n./openbaton.sh start\n\n\n\n\nStarting and stopping the Generic VNFM (and the other additional components)\n\n\nIf you are also using the Generic VNFM remember you can stop it with the following command:\n\n\ncd /opt/openbaton/generic-vnfm\n./generic-vnfm.sh stop\n\n\n\n\nand start it with the following command:\n\n\ncd /opt/openbaton/generic-vnfm\n./generic-vnfm.sh start\n\n\n\n\nNOTE\n - For all the other additional components the commands above still apply just adapted to the specific component (e.g.: for the Fault Management System you can use the 'fm-system.sh' script, etc.)\n\n\nConfigure it\n\n\nFor specific configuration refer to the \nconfiguration\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      // Creating custom :external selector\n      $.expr[':'].external = function(obj){\n          return !obj.href.match(/^mailto\\:/)\n                  && (obj.hostname != location.hostname);\n      };\n      $(function(){\n        $('a:external').addClass('external');\n        $(\".external\").attr('target','_blank');\n      })",

It is a compressed file that includes a TOSCA template of a Network Service, and all the scripts or files that a VNF needs for the lifecycle time from creation to termination.\nThe CSAR is a zip file with this structure:\n\n\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 Definitions\n|   \u2514\u2500\u2500 testNSDiperf.yaml\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 Scripts\n|   \u251c\u2500\u2500 install.sh   \n|   \u2514\u2500\u2500 (VNF TYPE)\n|        \u2514\u2500\u2500 script.sh \n\u2514\u2500\u2500 TOSCA-Metadata\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 Metadata.yaml\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 TOSCA.meta\n\n\n\n\n\nThe CSAR reader can read both NSDs and VNFDs written in TOSCA.

Configuration parameters are key-value pairs. Here is an example of a VNFD's \nconfigurations\n field:\n\n\n...\n\nconfigurations\n:{\n    \nname\n:\nconfig_name\n,\n    \nconfigurationParameters\n:[\n        {\n            \nconfKey\n:\nkey1\n,\n            \nvalue\n:\nthe_value\n\n        }\n    ]\n},\n...\n\n\n\n\nOut-of-the-box parameters\n\n\nThere are some out-of-the-box parameters that will be added automatically to the execution environment when running the scripts. These parameters are:\n\n\n\n\nThe IP address of the VNF\n\n\nThe floating IP address of the VNF (if it exists)\n\n\nThe hostname of the VNF\n\n\n\n\nProvides parameters\n\n\nThe VNFD's \nprovides\n field is not used when working with the Generic-VNFM so you can ignore them if you are not planning to use your own VNFM. The \nprovides\n field is a list of parameter keys that will be available in all your scripts. The difference is that these parameters are parameters whose actual value will be known only at runtime. For that reason these parameters can only be filled by a specific VNFM. So you need to implement a VNFM able to handle these specific parameters in the fillSpecificParameters method (see \nHow to write a VNFM\n).\n\n\n...\n\nprovides\n:[\n    \nparam1\n,\n    \nparam2\n\n]\n...\n\n\n\n\nHow to use the parameters\n\n\nAll of the parameters mentioned above are available inside the lifecycle event scripts of the corresponding VNFR as environment variables. You can refer to them with their key. For example, if you defined a configuration parameter with the key \ntitle\n and the value \nThis is the title\n, you can refer to it by writing \n$title\n inside your scripts.\n\n\nThe out-of-the-box parameters are a special case, since you did not specify a key for them. You can refer to them in the scripts like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOut-of-the-box-parameter\n\n\nUsage of variables in scripts\n\n\nValue\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe IP address\n\n\n$\n network_name \n\n\nThe IP address assigned to the virtual machine belonging to the network with name \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe floating IP address\n\n\n$\n network_name \n_floatingIp\n\n\nThe floating IP address assigned to the virtual machine belonging to the network with name \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe hostname\n\n\n$hostname\n\n\nThe hostname assigned to the virtual machine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n: Sometimes it may be that the names of VNF parameters are not conform with bash environment variables. For example if a network name contains a hyphen (e.g. network-one). In those cases are the hyphens replaced by Open Baton automatically with underscores. So in you scripts you would write \n$network_one\n instead of \n$network-one\n.\n\n\nHow to use parameters passed through a VNF dependency\n\n\nAs described \nhere\n, you can have VNF dependencies between VNFs and pass VNF parameters through these dependencies. If you want to use these parameters inside your scripts, you have to consider a few things. The VNF parameters passed through a VNF dependency are only available inside the CONFIGURE lifecycle event scripts and only if the script names start with the source VNF's type followed by an underscore. In other lifecycle events you will not be able to use them. Environment variables derived from VNF parameters passed through a VNF dependency have a special naming rule. If you have one VNF of type \nserver\n and another VNF of type \nclient\n and the server is the source and the client is the target of a VNF dependency passing some VNF parameters, then you have to prepend the type of the source VNF (in our case \nserver\n) to the environment variables for referring to the VNF parameters. Here is an example:\n\n\nAssume that we have the two VNFs described above, that means one of type \nserver\n and one of type \nclient\n. And we have a dependency between the two which passes the server's IP address and one of its configuration parameters to the client. Here is how such a dependency might look like:\n\n\n...\n\nvnf_dependency\n:[\n        {\n            \nsource\n:{\n                \nname\n:\nserver\n\n            },\n            \ntarget\n:{\n                \nname\n:\nclient\n\n            },\n            \nparameters\n:[\n                \nnetname\n,\n                \nconfParam\n\n            ]\n        }\n]\n...\n\n\n\n\nNow we can use the values of the two parameters \nnetname\n (which is the virtual link to which the server VNF is connected) and \nconfParam\n inside of the client's CONFIGURATION lifecycle scripts.\n\n\n#!/bin/bash\n\necho \nServer IP: $server_netname\n\necho \nServer configuration parameter: $server_confParam\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n: That the lifecycle script's name has to start with the source VNF's type and an underscore, in this case for example \nserver_configuration_script.sh\n\n\nConclusion\n\n\nYou are always able to use the parameters of a VNF simply using the key as variable name, but when you want to use a parameter of a different VNF (passed through a dependency) you need to specify the VNF type followed by an underscore and then the name of the foreign parameter key (for instance \n$typeExt_key\n).

Moreover you can specify a Floating IP to be assigned to this connection point in the form \"192.168.0.123\". Please be aware of the fact that the NFVO will try to allocate this IP from the external network associated to the tenant. Therefore it is important to have an already configured external network before making use of floating IPs.

All the available networks should be specified in the NSD-\nVLD, then in the VNFD-\nVL you specify which networks you want to use.\nFinally in the VNFD-\nVDU-\nVNFC-\nconnection_point you can specify which network to attach among those available in VNFD-\nVL. The virtual_link_reference parameter also must be filled with the exact same links.\n\n\nLifecycle Events\n\n\nA lifecycle event is composed by an Event and a list of strings that correspond to the script names needed to be run in that particular Event.\nCurrently supported events are:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvent name\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nINSTANTIATE\n\n\n...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCONFIGURE\n\n\n...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSTART\n\n\n...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTERMINATE\n\n\n...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCALE_IN\n\n\n...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe VNF events state machine follows the  state diagram for the VNFR (and NSR) displayed in \nthis slide\n\n\nDeployment Flavour\n\n\nA delpoyment flavour corresponds to a flavour name existing in the VimInstance.\nFor example if you are using Openstack as Vim, the flavour_key parameter shall correspond to a \nflavour name of Openstack\n (e.q. m1.small).\n\n\nInter-VNFs dependencies\n\n\nIn many cases, you may need or you may provide some information in order to interact with other VNFs inside a network service composition.
