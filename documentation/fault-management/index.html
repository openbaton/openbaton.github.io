<p>The Open Baton FMS project is an additional component of the framework, providing switch-to-standby and heal functionalities 
based on alarms received from the VIM.<br />
<strong>Note</strong>: If you have the bootstrap procedure and selected the installation of the FMS component, you could skip this section, and move to the <a href="#how-to">How to use AutoScaling Engine</a> one. 
if you followed the installation guide using the bootstrap, you can jump to the section "How to use Open Baton FM"</p>
<h1 id="technical-requirements">Technical Requirements</h1>
<p>The technical requirements are:  </p>
<ul>
<li>Zabbix plugin running (see the <a href="https://github.com/openbaton/docs/blob/develop/docs/zabbix-plugin.md">doc of Zabbix plugin</a>)</li>
<li>Mysql server installed and running</li>
<li>Open Baton running</li>
<li>Generic VNFM running</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="how-to-install-open-baton-fm">How to install Open Baton FM</h1>
<p>Once the prerequisites are met, you need to execute the following steps.</p>
<h2 id="create-the-database">Create the database</h2>
<p>In order to create the database be sure you have installed <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/linux-installation.html">mysql server</a> as already mentioned in the requirements section. 
You need root access to mysql-server in order to create a new database called faultmanagement. Once you access into mysql, execute the following operation: </p>
<pre><code class="bash">create database faultmanagement;
</code></pre>

<p>Once the database has been created, you should create a user which will be used by the FM system to access and store data on the database. If you decide to use the <code>root</code> user you can skip this step, but you need to modify the fms.properties file accordingly as defined in the next section. 
By default, username and password are set with the following values in the fms.properties properties file (see next section if you plan to use a different user and password): </p>
<ul>
<li>username=fmsuser</li>
<li>password=changeme</li>
</ul>
<p>Grant the access to the database "faultmanagement", to the user, running the following command:</p>
<pre><code class="bash">GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON faultmanagement.* TO fmsuser@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'changeme';
</code></pre>

<h2 id="modify-fmsproperties-file-in-order-to-use-different-credentials-for-the-database">Modify fms.properties file in order to use different credentials for the database</h2>
<p>In the folder "etc" of this project, there is a file called fms.properties containing all the default properties values used by the FM system. </p>
<p>In order to use different credentials, you need to modify the following DB properties: </p>
<pre><code class="bash"># DB properties
spring.datasource.username=fmsuser
spring.datasource.password=changeme
</code></pre>

<p>In case your DB is running remotely, you can specifcy a different host, instead of localhost, in the following property (be careful to have port 3306 open and accessible from remote): </p>
<pre><code class="bash">spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/faultmanagement
</code></pre>

<h2 id="additional-configuration-options">Additional configuration options</h2>
<p>As already mentioned in the previous section, in the folder "etc" of this project, there is a file called fms.properties containing all the default properties values used by the FM system.
You should update this file in order to make it work with your NFVO instance. Change the Open Baton related properties section: </p>
<pre><code class="bash">################################################
####### Open Baton Related properties ##########
################################################
nfvo.ip=localhost
nfvo.port=8080
nfvo-usr=admin
nfvo-pwd=openbaton
</code></pre>

<h2 id="checkout-the-source-code-of-the-project-compile-and-run-it">Checkout the source code of the project, compile and run it</h2>
<p>You can clone this repository with this command:</p>
<pre><code class="bash">git clone https://github.com/openbaton/fm-system.git
</code></pre>

<p>The configuration file is etc/fms.properties, you have to copy it in the Open Baton etc folder ( /etc/openbaton ). You can do it typing the following command </p>
<pre><code class="bash">cd fm-system
cp etc/fms.properties /etc/openbaton/fms.properties
</code></pre>

<p>Now, you can finally compile and start the FM System. </p>
<pre><code class="bash">./fm-system.sh compile start
</code></pre>

<h1 id="how-to-use-the-fms"><a name="how-to"> How to use the FMS</h1>
<p>Open Baton FM is a rule-driven tool. The rules define when to generate an alarm and how to react. 
The rule for generating the alarm is called fault management policy (see the next section). 
The rule for defining how to react upon alarms is a Drools Rule. Once such rules are in place, Open Baton FM follows the following workflow.</p>
<p><img alt="Fault management system use case" src="../images/fms-use-case.png" /></p>
<p>The actions are listed below:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>ACTION</th>
<th>DESCRIPTION</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Heal</td>
<td>The VNFM executes the scripts in the Heal lifecycle event (in the VNFD). The message contains the cause of the fault, which can be used in the scripts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Switch to stanby VNFC (Stateless)</td>
<td>If the VDU requires redoundancy active-passive, there will be a component VNFC<em> in standby mode. This action consists in: activate the VNFC</em>, route all signalling and data flow(s) for VNFC to VNFC*, deactivate VNFC.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Switch to stanby VNFC (Stateful)</td>
<td>To investigate. Refer on ETSI GS NFV-REL 001 v1.1.1 (2015-01) Chapter 11.2.1.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h2 id="write-a-fault-management-policy">Write a fault management policy</h2>
<p>The fault management policy needs to be present in the VNFD, in particular in the VDU. This is an example of fault management policy:</p>
<pre><code class="json">&quot;fault_management_policy&quot;:[
    {
      &quot;name&quot;:&quot;web server not available&quot;,
      &quot;isVNFAlarm&quot;: true,
      &quot;criteria&quot;:[
      {
        &quot;parameter_ref&quot;:&quot;net.tcp.listen[80]&quot;,
        &quot;function&quot;:&quot;last()&quot;,
        &quot;vnfc_selector&quot;:&quot;at_least_one&quot;,
        &quot;comparison_operator&quot;:&quot;=&quot;,
        &quot;threshold&quot;:&quot;0&quot;
      }
      ],
      &quot;period&quot;:5,
      &quot;severity&quot;:&quot;CRITICAL&quot;

<h2 id="how-the-heal-method-works">How the HEAL method works</h2>
<p>The Heal VNF operation is a method of the VNF lifecycle management interface described in the ETSI <a href="http://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_gs/NFV-MAN/001_099/001/01.01.01_60/gs_nfv-man001v010101p.pdf">NFV MANO</a> specifications. Here is reported the description and the notes about this method:</p>
<pre><code>Description: this operation is used to request appropriate correction actions in reaction to a failure.
Notes: This assumes operational behaviour for healing actions by VNFM has been described in the VNFD. An example might be switching between active and standby mode.
</code></pre>

<p>In the ETSI draft "NFV-IFA007v040" at <a href="https://docbox.etsi.org/isg/nfv/open/Drafts/IFA007_Or-Vnfm_ref_point_Spec/">this</a> page, the Heal VNF message is defined as:</p>
<pre><code>vnfInstanceId  : Identifies the VNF instance requiring a healing action. 
cause : Indicates the reason why a healing procedure is required. 
</code></pre>

<p>Once the fault management system received an alarm from the VIM, 
it checks, if the alarm is referred to a VNF and sends the Heal VNF message to the NFVO which forwards it to the respective VNFM.
The VNFM executes in the failed VNFC the scripts in the HEAL lifecycle event.
Here an example of the heal script you can use:</p>
<pre><code class="bash">#!/bin/bash

case &quot;$cause&quot; in

(&quot;serviceDown&quot;) 
    echo &quot;Apache is down, let's try to restart it...&quot;
    service apache2 restart
    if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
        echo &quot;ERROR: the Apache service is not started&quot;
        exit 1
        fi
    echo &quot;The Apache service is running again!&quot;
    ;;
*) echo &quot;The cause $cause is unknown&quot;
    exit 2
    ;;
esac
</code></pre>

<p>The variable $cause is specified in the Drools rule. In our case it is "serviceDown" and we try to restart the Apache server.</p>
<h2 id="drools-rules">Drools Rules</h2>
<p>The Open Baton FMS is a rule-based system. Such rules are specified in Drools language and processed by the Drools engine in the Open Baton FMS.
An example rule looks like the following:</p>
<pre><code>rule &quot;Save a VNFAlarm&quot;
    when
        vnfAlarm : VNFAlarm()
    then
    VNFAlarm alarm = vnfAlarmRepository.save(vnfAlarm);
    logger.debug(&quot;Saved VnfAlarm: &quot;+alarm);
end
</code></pre>

<p>This rule saves a VNF Alarm in the database.
The following rule executes the HEAL action once a VNF Alarm is received:</p>
<pre><code>rule &quot;Got a critical VNF Alarm and execute the HEAL action&quot;

    when
       vnfAlarm : VNFAlarm(  alarmState == AlarmState.FIRED, perceivedSeverity == PerceivedSeverity.CRITICAL)
    then

    //Get the vnfr
    VirtualNetworkFunctionRecord vnfr = nfvoRequestorWrapper.getVirtualNetworkFunctionRecord(vnfAlarm.getVnfrId());

    //Get the vnfc failed (assuming only one vnfc is failed)
    VNFCInstance vnfcInstance = nsrManager.getVNFCInstanceFromVnfr(vnfr,vnfAlarm.getVnfcIds().iterator().next());

    logger.info(&quot;(VNF LAYER) A CRITICAL alarm is received by the vnfc: &quot;+vnfcInstance.getHostname());

    //Get the vdu of the failed VNFC
    VirtualDeploymentUnit vdu = nfvoRequestorWrapper.getVDU(vnfr,vnfcInstance.getId());

    logger.info(&quot;Heal fired!&quot;);
    highAvailabilityManager.executeHeal(&quot;serviceDown&quot;,vnfr.getParent_ns_id(),vnfr.getId(),vdu.getId(),vnfcInstance.getId());

    //Insert a new recovery action

    RecoveryAction recoveryAction= new RecoveryAction(RecoveryActionType.HEAL,vnfr.getEndpoint(),&quot;&quot;);
    recoveryAction.setStatus(RecoveryActionStatus.IN_PROGRESS);
    insert(recoveryAction);
end
</code></pre>

<h2 id="how-the-switch-to-standby-works">How the Switch to Standby works</h2>
<p>The Switch to Standby action can be performed by the Open Baton FMS once a VNFC in standby is present in the VNF. Its main action is switch the service from a VNFC to the VNFC in standby automatically.
In order to have a VNFC in standby, such information must be included in the VNFD, in particular in the VDU, as the following:</p>
<pre><code>&quot;high_availability&quot;:{
    &quot;resiliencyLevel&quot;:&quot;ACTIVE_STANDBY_STATELESS&quot;,
    &quot;redundancyScheme&quot;:&quot;1:N&quot;
}
</code></pre>

<p>This information will be processed by the Open Baton FMS which will create a VNFC instance in standby.
Then in a Drools rule this action can be called as following:</p>
<pre><code>highAvailabilityManager.switchToRedundantVNFC(failedVnfcInstance,vnfr,vdu);
</code></pre>

          The Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft zur Förderung der angewandten Forschung e.V. (Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft)
          takes the protection of your personal data very seriously. When we process the personal data that is
          collected during your visits to our Web site, we always observe the rules laid down in the
          applicable data protection laws. Your data will not be disclosed publicly by us, nor transferred to
          any third parties without your consent.
          <br>
          <br>

          <b>1. Recording and processing of data in connection with access over the Internet</b><br>
          When you visit our Web site, our Web server makes a temporary record of each access and stores it in
          a log file. The following data are recorded, and stored until an automatic deletion date:
        <ul>
          <li>IP address of the requesting processor</li>
          <li>Date and time of access</li>
          <li>Name and URL of the downloaded file</li>
          <li>Volume of data transmitted</li>
          <li>Indication whether download was successful</li>
          <li>Data identifying the browser software and operating system</li>
          <li>Web site from which our site was accessed</li>
          <li>Name of your Internet service provider</li>
        </ul>
        The purpose of recording these data is to allow use of the Web site (connection setup), for system
        security, for technical administration of the network infrastructure and in order to op-timize our
        Internet service. The IP address is only evaluated in the event of fraudulent access to the network
        infrastructure of the Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft.
        <br>
        Apart from the special cases cited above, we do not process personal data without first obtaining your
        explicit consent to do so. Pseudonymous user profiles can be created as stated under web analysis (see
        below).

        <br>
        <br>
        <b>​2. Orders</b><br>
        If you order information material or other goods via our website, we will use the address data provided
        only for the purpose of processing your order.

        <br>
        <br>
        <b>3. Use and transfer of personal data</b><br>
        All use of your personal data is confined to the purposes stated above, and is only under-taken to the
        extent necessary for these purposes. Your data is not disclosed to third parties.
        <br>
        Personal data will not be transferred to government bodies or public authorities except in order to
        comply with mandatory national legislation or if the transfer of such data should be necessary in order
        to take legal action in cases of fraudulent access to our network infrastructure. Personal data will not
        be transferred for any other purpose.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>4. Consent to use data in other contexts</b><br>

        The use of certain services on our website, such as newsletters or discussion forums, may re-quire prior
        registration and involves a more substantial processing of personal data, such as longer-term storage of
        e-mail addresses, user IDs and passwords. We use such data only insofar as it has been sent to us by you
        in person and you have given us your express prior consent for this use. For example, we request your
        consent separately in the following cases:
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>4.1 Newsletters and press distribution</b><br>

        In order to register for a newsletter service provided by the Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft, we need at least
        your e-mail address so that we know where to send the newsletter. All other information you supply is on
        a voluntary basis, and will be only if you give your consent, for example to contact you directly or
        clear up questions concerning your e-mail address. If you request delivery by post, we need your postal
        address. If you ask to be included on a press distribution list, we need to know which publication you
        work for, to allow us to check whether specific publications are actually receiving our press material.
        <br>
        As a general rule, we employ the double opt-in method for the registration. In other words, after you
        have registered for the service and informed us of your e-mail address, you will receive an e-mail in
        return from us, containing a link that you must use to con-firm your registration. Your registration and
        confirmation will be recorded. The newsletter will not be sent until this has been done. This procedure
        is used to ensure that only you yourself can register with the newsletter service under the specified
        e-mail address. You must confirm your registration as soon as possible after receiving our e-mail,
        otherwise your registration and e-mail address will be erased from our database. Until we receive your
        confirmation, our newsletter service will refuse to accept any other registration re-quests using this
        e-mail address.
        <br>
        You can cancel subscriptions to our newsletters at any time. To do so, either send us an e-mail or
        follow the link at the end of the newsletter.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>​4.2 Visitors’ books and forums</b><br>
        If you wish to sign up for an Internet forum run by the Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft, we need at least a user
        ID, a password, and your e-mail address. For your own protection, the reg-istration procedure for this
        type of service, like that for the newsletters, involves you con-firming your request using the link
        contained in the e-mail we send you and you giving your consent to the use of further personal data
        where this is necessary to use the forum.
        <br>
        You can cancel your registration for this type of service at any time, by sending us an e-mail via the
        Web page offering the service.
        <br>
        As a general rule, the content of visitors’ books and forums is not subject to any form of monitoring by
        the Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft. Nevertheless, we reserve the right to delete posted contributions and to
        prohibit users from further use of the service at our own dis-cretion, especially in cases where posted
        content contravenes the law or is deemed in-compatible with the objectives of the
        Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft.
        <br>
        <br>

        <b>5. Cookies</b><br>
        We don’t normally use cookies on our Web site, but in certain exceptional cases we may use cookies which
        place technical session-control data in your browser’s memory. These data are automatically erased at
        the latest when you close your browser.
        <br>
        If, exceptionally, one of our applications requires the storage of personal data in a cookie, for
        instance a user ID, we will point out you to it.
        <br>
        Of course, it is perfectly possible to consult our Web site without the use of cookies. Please note,
        however, that most browsers are programmed to accept cookies in their de-fault configuration. You can
        prevent this by changing the appropriate setting in the browser options. If you set the browser to
        refuse all cookies, this may restrict your use of certain functions on our Website
        <br>
        <br>

        <b>6. Web analysis</b><br>
        Personal user profiles are not created. However, Section 15 (3) of the Telemedia Act (TMG) permits the
        use of user profiles under a pseudonym for the purpose of advertising, market research and the
        structuring of offers in line with the user's needs provided that the user does not object to this:
        <br>
        We also use web analysis services on our web pages, for example from etracker or WiredMinds, which carry
        out the web analysis on our behalf as contract processors (see the websites of www.wiredminds.de for
        these providers). Their services have been checked by the supervisory authorities and/or experts and
        meet all requirements under German and European data protection laws.
        <br>
        Using the technologies of these providers, data is collected and stored on our website. From this data,
        user profiles are produced under a pseudonym for marketing and optimi-zation purposes, for which cookies
        may be used. Cookies are small text files that are stored locally in the cache memory of the site
        visitor's web browser. The cookies enable the web browser to be recognized. Furthermore, your user
        behavior can be measured via a JavaScript code and data collected in this connection can be sent
        directly to the provider's servers in Germany or the EU via an HTML connection. Without your express
        consent, the data collected using the tracking technologies will not be used to personally identify you
        and will not be combined with the personal data about the bearer of the pseudonym. No cross-website
        analysis will be carried out either.
        <br>
        <br> If you wish to technically stop the tracking, you can deactivate JavaScript and cookies in your web
        browser. Consent for the collection and storage of data can also be refused with effect for the future
        at any time. Please follow this link to refuse the service provided by WiredMinds:
        <a href="http://wm.wiredminds.de">http://wm.wiredminds.de.</a>
        <br>
        <br>

        <b>7. Social plugins</b><br>
        We also use social plugins in some cases on our webpages, e.g. from the Facebook, Twit-ter, YouTube or
        Google+ social networks. These are often technically operated in the USA or in other countries outside
        Germany and the EU and some are offered via national companies in the EU (see the websites
        www.facebook.de, www.twitter.de, www.youtube.de or www.google.de for the providers). The plugins are
        identified with the companies’ logo, comment fields or what are known as a “Like” or “+1” button.
        <br>
        If you open a page of our website in your web browser containing such a plugin, your web browser will
        create a direct connection to the servers of the respective provider in the country concerned.
        <br>
        By incorporating the plugins the provider is given at the least the information that you have visited a
        certain page on our website, and perhaps also other information that your web browser or the device you
        use also discloses. The content of the plugin is loaded by your web browser directly from the provider
        and incorporated into our website. If you are registered and have logged in with the provider concerned,
        your visit can also be assigned to your user account.
        <br>
        If you interact with a plugin, e.g. if you click on the “Like” button or enter a comment in a form
        field, your browser will also transmit this information directly to the provider where it will be saved
        and, if applicable, continue to be used and published.
        <br>
        Above all, marketing measures of the provider and the Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft are the reason for the
        collection and use of the data as described and determine the extent of this. You can find details on
        this and on your rights and on ways in which you can pre-vent the collection and use of your data in
        order to protect your private sphere directly in the data privacy policy of the respective provider.
        <br>
        If you do not wish a provider to collect data on you through our website you must deacti-vate the
        plugins in your web browser. If you wish to avoid a link to any existing user account, you must log out
        before your visit to our website. By visiting our website, you de-clare your consent to the above
        provisions.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>8. Security </b><br>
        The Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft implements technical and organizational security measures to safeguard
        stored personal data against inadvertent or deliberate manipulation, loss or destruction and against
        access by unauthorized persons. Our security measures are continuously im-proved in line with
        technological progress.
        <br><br>
        <b>9. Links to Web sites operated by other providers</b><br>
        Our Web pages may contain links to other providers’ Web pages. We would like to point out that this
        statement of data protection conditions applies exclusively to the Web pages managed by the
        Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft. We have no way of influencing the practices of other providers with respect to
        data protection, nor do we carry out any checks to ensure that they conform with the relevant
        legislation.
        <br><br>
        <b>10. Right to information and contact data</b><br>
        You have a legal right to inspect any stored data concerning your person, and also the right to demand
        their correction or deletion, and to withdraw your consent for their further use.
        <br>
        In some cases, if you are a registered user of certain services provided by the Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft,
        we offer you the possibility of inspecting these data online, and even of deleting or modifying the data
        yourself, via a user account.
        <br>
        If you wish to obtain information on your personal data, or want us to correct or erase such data, or if
        you have any other questions concerning the use of personal data held by us, please contact: <a
              href="mailto:data-protection@zv.fraunhofer.de">data-protection@zv.fraunhofer.de</a>
        <br><br>
        <b>11. Acceptance, validity and modification of data protection conditions</b><br>
        By using our Web site, you implicitly agree to accept the use of your personal data as specified above.
        This present statement of data protection conditions came into effect on October 1st, 2013. As our Web
        site evolves, and new technologies come into use, it may become necessary to amend the statement of data
        protection conditions. The Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft reserves the right to modify its data protection
        conditions at any time, with effect as of a future date. We recommend that you reread the latest version
        from time to time.
