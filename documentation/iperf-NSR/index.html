                          <h1 id="tutorial-iperf-network-service">Tutorial: iPerf Network Service</h1>
<p>This tutorial explains how to deploy a network service that uses iPerf.<br />
<a href="https://iperf.fr">iPerf</a> is a tool for active measurements of the maximum achievable bandwidth between two or more machines where an iPerf client connects to an iPerf server.</p>
<p>You can execute also the same tutorial using the <a href="../tosca-iperf-scenario">TOSCA</a> definitions.</p>
<p>This tutorial makes use of:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/openbaton/NFVO">NFVO</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/openbaton/generic-vnfm">Generic VNFM</a></li>
<li>Generic <a href="https://github.com/openbaton/ems/tree/master">EMS</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/openbaton/openstack-plugin">OpenStack vim driver</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>
<p>In order to execute this scenario, you need to have the following components up and running:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://github.com/openbaton/NFVO">NFVO</a></li>
<li>the <a href="https://github.com/openbaton/openstack-plugin">OpenStack vim driver</a></li>
<li>the <a href="https://github.com/openbaton/generic-vnfm">Generic VNFM</a></li>
<li>Configured and running OpenStack environment</li>
</ul>
<p>Start the NFVO and Generic VNFM depending on how you <a href="../nfvo-installation">installed</a> it.<br />
If you used the bootstrap script for installing you do not have to care about the OpenStack vim driver as it will be installed already.</p>
<h3 id="run-it-with-docker">Run it with Docker</h3>
<p>You can find a <a href="../compose/min-compose.yml">docker-compose</a> file ready to launch the required components for this tutorial. Assuming that you have installed the latest version of Docker and Docker Compose, download the <a href="../compose/min-compose.yml">docker-compose</a> file and execute the following command: </p>
<pre><code class="bash">HOST_IP=192.168.42.42 docker-compose -p ob -f min-compose.yml up -d
</code></pre>

<p>Where the HOST_IP parameter is the IP of your host where you are executing the docker containers. Please note that the IP must be reachable from the OpenStack environment (in particular from the VMs created)
for allowing the EMS agent to reach back the Generic VNFM. </p>
<p>Feel free to adapt the min-compose.yml file as you wish including other components you may need.</p>
<p><strong>important note</strong> the NFVO uses the in memory database, thus anything stored in the NFVO won't be persisted after restart of the container. </p>
<h2 id="store-the-vim-instance">Store the Vim Instance</h2>
<p>For registering the Point of Presence of type OpenStack to the NFVO you have to upload a Vim Instance. You can use the following <a href="../descriptors/vim-instance/openstack-vim-instance.json">json descriptor</a> by changing the values to your needs.</p>
<h3 id="using-the-dashboard">Using the dashboard</h3>
<p>If you want to use the Dashboard (checkout the <a href="../nfvo-how-to-use-gui">dashboard documentation</a> for more information on how to use it), open it at the URL http://ip-where-nfvo-runs:8080 (change port and protocol if you use SSL) and log in (default username and password are <em>admin</em> and <em>openbaton</em>).<br />
Go to <code>Manage PoPs -&gt; PoP Instances</code> and choose the Vim Instance of your choice by clicking on <code>Register a new PoP</code> and selecting the Vim Instance's json file.</p>
<p><img alt="Onboarding-Vim" src="../images/tutorials/tutorial-iperf-NSR/vim-onboarding.png" /></p>
<h3 id="using-the-cli">Using the CLI</h3>
<p>If you want to use the CLI (checkout the <a href="../nfvo-how-to-use-cli">Open Baton Client documentation</a> for more information on how to install and use it), you need to execute the following command in order to onboard the Vim Instance where <em>vim-instance.json</em> is the path to the Vim Instance file:</p>
<pre><code class="bash">$./openbaton.sh VimInstance-create vim-instance.json
</code></pre>

<h2 id="store-the-network-service-descriptor">Store the Network Service Descriptor</h2>
<p>Download the <a href="../descriptors/tutorial-iperf-NSR/tutorial-iperf-NSR-privateIPs.json">iPerf NSD using private IPs</a> or <a href="../descriptors/tutorial-iperf-NSR/tutorial-iperf-NSR-floatingIPs.json">iPerf NSD using floating IPs</a>, and upload it in the catalogue either using the dashboard or the CLI.<br />
The difference is that the first NSD will deploy Virtual Machines without floating IPs on OpenStack whereas the second one will use floating IPs.</p>
<h3 id="using-the-dashboard_1">Using the dashboard</h3>
<p>If you want to use the Dashboard go to <code>Catalogue -&gt; NS Descriptors</code> and choose the NSD of your choice by clicking on <code>On Board NSD -&gt; Upload JSON</code> and selecting the Descriptor's json file.</p>
<p><img alt="Onboarding-NSD" src="../images/tutorials/tutorial-iperf-NSR/nsd-onboarding.png" /></p>
<h3 id="using-the-cli_1">Using the CLI</h3>
<p>If you want to use the CLI you need to execute the following command in order to onboard the NSD:</p>
<pre><code class="bash">$./openbaton.sh NetworkServiceDescriptor-create tutorial-iperf-NSD.json

<h2 id="deploy-the-network-service-descriptor">Deploy the Network Service Descriptor</h2>
<p>As soon as you onboarded the NSD in the NFVO you can deploy this NSD either by using the dashboard or the CLI.<br />
This will create a Network Service Record (NSR) and actually launch the Virtual Machines on OpenStack.</p>
<h3 id="using-the-dashboard_2">Using the dashboard</h3>
<p>This part shows you how to deploy an onboarded NSD via the dashboard. You need to go to the GUI again and navigate to <code>Catalogue -&gt; NS Descriptors</code>. Open the drop down menu by clicking on <code>Action</code>. Afterwards you need to press the <code>Launch</code> button and a window with launching options will appear. Just click on <code>Launch</code> again in order to start the deployment of this NSD.</p>
<p><img alt="nsr-deploy" src="../images/tutorials/tutorial-iperf-NSR/nsr-deploy.png" /></p>
<p>If you go to <code>Orchestrate NS -&gt; NS Records</code> in the menu on the left side, you can follow the deployment process and check the current status of the created NSR.</p>
<h3 id="using-the-cli_2">Using the CLI</h3>
<p>You can also use the CLI for deploying existing NSDs. The command needs the ID of the NSD to deploy as an argument. It can be found either by using the dashboard or getting it from the output when onboarding a new NSD as done in the previous step. The command to deploy the previously onboarded NSD looks like shown below:</p>
<pre><code class="bash">$./openbaton.sh NetworkServiceRecord-create f2086f71-4ecf-4ed8-a692-36775ebdfc68 vimmap.json keypair.json conf.json
</code></pre>

<p>The first argument is the ID of the NSD from which the NSR will be created. The following arguments are files that can contain additional configuration while deploying.
You have to pass these files even if you do not want to pass any configuration like in our case. So just create the three files and fill them with empty json objects/arrays (i.e. <em>{}</em> and <em>[]</em>).<br />
The <em>vimmap.json</em> and the <em>conf.json</em> files should contain this:</p>
<pre><code class="json">{}
</code></pre>

<p>And the <em>keypair.json</em> file this:</p>
<pre><code class="json">[]
</code></pre>

<p>The execution of this command produces the following output:</p>

<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
<p>When all the VNF Records are done with all of the scripts defined in the lifecycle events, the NFVO will put the state of the VNF Record to ACTIVE and when all the VNF Records are in state ACTIVE, also the Network Service Record will be in state ACTIVE. This means that the service is deployed correctly. For learning more about the states of a VNF Record please refer to the <a href="../vnfr-states">VNF Record state documentation</a>.</p>
<h1 id="additional-information-about-this-scenario">Additional information about this scenario</h1>
<p>When you access your OpenStack dashboard you should be able to see the deployed Virtual Machines. One of them will act as an iPerf server and the other one as an iPerf client that connects to the server.</p>
<p>The following pictures shows the deployment.</p>
<p><img alt="iperf-deployment" src="../images/use-case-example-iperf-client-server.png" /></p>
<p>As indicated by the blue arrow the iperf server is the source of a dependency and the client is the target. In this case the client needs the IP of the server in order to connect.
Let's have a look at the NSD we used to deploy this scenario in order to see how the dependencies are described.<br />
You will see that the NSD contains a field called <em>vnf_dependency</em>.</p>
<pre><code class="json">&quot;vnf_dependency&quot;:[
    {
      &quot;source&quot;:{
        &quot;name&quot;:&quot;iperf-server&quot;
      },
      &quot;target&quot;:{
        &quot;name&quot;:&quot;iperf-client&quot;
      },
      &quot;parameters&quot;:[
        &quot;private_floatingIp&quot;
      ]
    }
  ]
</code></pre>

<p>The json array <em>vnf_dependency</em> may contain multiple dependencies. In our case it is just one, which describes that the VNFD named <em>iperf-client</em> needs a parameter called <em>private_floaingIp</em> from the VNFD <em>iperf-server</em>. This parameter can be used by the iperf-client as a variable in its lifecycle scripts.</p>
<p>Also the lifecycle scripts are specified in the NSD. For example the VNFD <em>iperf-client</em> has the following lifecycle events:</p>
<pre><code class="json">&quot;lifecycle_event&quot;:[
        {
          &quot;event&quot;:&quot;CONFIGURE&quot;,
          &quot;lifecycle_events&quot;:[
            &quot;server_configure_floatingIp.sh&quot;
          ]
        },
        {
          &quot;event&quot;:&quot;INSTANTIATE&quot;,
          &quot;lifecycle_events&quot;:[
            &quot;install.sh&quot;
          ]
        }
      ]
</code></pre>

<p>You can see that there is one lifecycle event called <em>INSTANTIATE</em> and one called <em>CONFIGURE</em>. Actually there exist also other lifecycle events, read about them <a href="../vnf-descriptor">here</a>.<br />
Each one will be executed at a different point in time. By execution we mean that the scripts that are listed in the <em>lifecycle_events</em> field will run with root permissions on the Virtual Machine.<br />
The scripts are located in a public git repository. The url is specified in the <em>vnfPackageLocation</em> field in the VNFDs.<br />
In our example the <em>INSTANTIATE</em> event will run first after the Virtual Machine was initialized. It will run the <em>install.sh</em> script which installs iPerf and screen on the Virtual Machine.<br />
The <em>CONFIGURE</em> lifecycle event starts after the <em>INSTANTIATE</em> lifecycle event. The <em>CONFIGURE</em> lifecycle event has a special role. In the lifecycle scripts of this event the dependency parameters are available.<br />
That is why we use this event to tell iPerf to connect to the server ip. In the example NSD that uses floating IPs the dependency parameter is called <em>private_floatingIp</em>.
In the <em>CONFIGURE</em> lifecycle script we will therefore run</p>
<pre><code class="bash">screen -d -m -S client iperf -c $server_private_floatingIp -t 300
</code></pre>

<p>You wonder why the variable in the script has another name than the dependency parameter? Well, you have to prepend the type of the source VNFD and an underscore to the variable. This is why <em>private_floatingIp</em> becomes <em>server_private_floatingIp</em>.<br />
And there is another restriction. In order to use the dependency parameter in the <em>CONFIGURE</em> script its name has to start with the source VNFD type followed by an underscore.<br />
If you want to learn more about dependencies, lifecycle events and variables read <a href="../vnfm-generic">this</a> section.</p>
<h2 id="the-process-in-details">The process in details</h2>
<p>Let's again have a look at the sequence diagram of a create Network Service Record operation.</p>
<p><img alt="CreateNSR Sequence Diagram" src="../images/use-case-example-sequence-diagram-os-vnfm-ems.png" /></p>
<p>When the Network Service Record create is called with the Iperf Network Service Descriptor's id, the steps defined in the sequence diagram above happen.</p>
<h5 id="instantiate-method">INSTANTIATE Method</h5>
<p>The first message sent to the Generic VNFM is the INSTANTIATE message <strong>(1)</strong>. This message contains the VNF Descriptor and some other parameters needed to create the VNF Record, for instance the list of Virtual Link Records. The Generic VNFM  is called and then the create Virtual Network Function Record and the Virtual Network Function Record is created <strong>(2)</strong> and sent back to the NFVO into a GrantOperation message <strong>(3)</strong>. This message will trigger the NFVO to check if there are enough resources to create that VNF Record. If so, then a GrantOperation message with the updated VNF Record is sent back to the Generic VNFManager. Then the Generic VNFManager creates an AllocateResources message with the received VNF Record and sends it to the NFVO <strong>(4)</strong>. After creating the resources (VMs) the NFVO sends back the AllocateResources message to the VNFManager. Here the instantiate method is called <strong>(5)</strong>. Inside this method, the scripts contained in the VNF Package (or the git repository containing the scripts) is sent to the EMS, the scripts are saved locally to the VM and then the Generic VNFManager will call the execution of each script defined in the VNF Descriptor <strong>(6)</strong>. Once all of the scripts are executed and there wasn't any error, the VNFManager sends the Instantiate message back to the NFVO <strong>(7)</strong>.</p>
<h5 id="modify-method">MODIFY Method</h5>
<p>If the VNF is target for some dependencies, like the iperf client, the MODIFY message is sent to the VNFManager by the NFVO <strong>(8)</strong>. Then the VNFManager executes the scripts contained in the CONFIGURE lifecycle event defined in the VNF Descriptor <strong>(9)</strong>, and sends back the modify message to the NFVO <strong>(10)</strong>, if no errors occurred. In this case, the scripts environment will contain the variables defined in the related VNF dependency.</p>
<h5 id="start-method">START Method</h5>
<p>Here exactly as before, the NFVO sends the START message to the Generic VNFManager <strong>(11)</strong>, and the VNFManager calls the EMS for execution of the scripts defined in the START lifecycle (none for this example) <strong>(12)</strong>. And the start message is then sent back to the NFVO meaning that no errors occurred <strong>(13)</strong>.</p>

          Hopefully that has clarified things for you and as was previously mentioned if there is something
          that you aren't sure whether you need or not it's usually safer to leave cookies enabled in case it
          does interact with one of the features you use on our site. However if you are still looking for

          The Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft zur Förderung der angewandten Forschung e.V. (Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft)
          takes the protection of your personal data very seriously. When we process the personal data that is
          collected during your visits to our Web site, we always observe the rules laid down in the
          applicable data protection laws. Your data will not be disclosed publicly by us, nor transferred to
          any third parties without your consent.
          <br>
          <br>

          <b>1. Recording and processing of data in connection with access over the Internet</b><br>
          When you visit our Web site, our Web server makes a temporary record of each access and stores it in
          a log file. The following data are recorded, and stored until an automatic deletion date:
        <ul>
          <li>IP address of the requesting processor</li>
          <li>Date and time of access</li>
          <li>Name and URL of the downloaded file</li>
          <li>Volume of data transmitted</li>
          <li>Indication whether download was successful</li>
          <li>Data identifying the browser software and operating system</li>
          <li>Web site from which our site was accessed</li>
          <li>Name of your Internet service provider</li>
        </ul>
        The purpose of recording these data is to allow use of the Web site (connection setup), for system
        security, for technical administration of the network infrastructure and in order to op-timize our
        Internet service. The IP address is only evaluated in the event of fraudulent access to the network
        infrastructure of the Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft.
        <br>
        Apart from the special cases cited above, we do not process personal data without first obtaining your
        explicit consent to do so. Pseudonymous user profiles can be created as stated under web analysis (see
        below).

        <br>
        <br>
        <b>​2. Orders</b><br>
        If you order information material or other goods via our website, we will use the address data provided
        only for the purpose of processing your order.

        <br>
        <br>
        <b>3. Use and transfer of personal data</b><br>
        All use of your personal data is confined to the purposes stated above, and is only under-taken to the
        extent necessary for these purposes. Your data is not disclosed to third parties.
        <br>
        Personal data will not be transferred to government bodies or public authorities except in order to
        comply with mandatory national legislation or if the transfer of such data should be necessary in order
        to take legal action in cases of fraudulent access to our network infrastructure. Personal data will not
        be transferred for any other purpose.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>4. Consent to use data in other contexts</b><br>

        The use of certain services on our website, such as newsletters or discussion forums, may re-quire prior
        registration and involves a more substantial processing of personal data, such as longer-term storage of
        e-mail addresses, user IDs and passwords. We use such data only insofar as it has been sent to us by you
        in person and you have given us your express prior consent for this use. For example, we request your
        consent separately in the following cases:
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>4.1 Newsletters and press distribution</b><br>

        In order to register for a newsletter service provided by the Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft, we need at least
        your e-mail address so that we know where to send the newsletter. All other information you supply is on
        a voluntary basis, and will be only if you give your consent, for example to contact you directly or
        clear up questions concerning your e-mail address. If you request delivery by post, we need your postal
        address. If you ask to be included on a press distribution list, we need to know which publication you
        work for, to allow us to check whether specific publications are actually receiving our press material.
        <br>
        As a general rule, we employ the double opt-in method for the registration. In other words, after you
        have registered for the service and informed us of your e-mail address, you will receive an e-mail in
        return from us, containing a link that you must use to con-firm your registration. Your registration and
        confirmation will be recorded. The newsletter will not be sent until this has been done. This procedure
        is used to ensure that only you yourself can register with the newsletter service under the specified
        e-mail address. You must confirm your registration as soon as possible after receiving our e-mail,
        otherwise your registration and e-mail address will be erased from our database. Until we receive your
        confirmation, our newsletter service will refuse to accept any other registration re-quests using this
        e-mail address.
        <br>
        You can cancel subscriptions to our newsletters at any time. To do so, either send us an e-mail or
        follow the link at the end of the newsletter.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>​4.2 Visitors’ books and forums</b><br>
        If you wish to sign up for an Internet forum run by the Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft, we need at least a user
        ID, a password, and your e-mail address. For your own protection, the reg-istration procedure for this
        type of service, like that for the newsletters, involves you con-firming your request using the link
        contained in the e-mail we send you and you giving your consent to the use of further personal data
        where this is necessary to use the forum.
        <br>
        You can cancel your registration for this type of service at any time, by sending us an e-mail via the
        Web page offering the service.
        <br>
        As a general rule, the content of visitors’ books and forums is not subject to any form of monitoring by
        the Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft. Nevertheless, we reserve the right to delete posted contributions and to
        prohibit users from further use of the service at our own dis-cretion, especially in cases where posted
        content contravenes the law or is deemed in-compatible with the objectives of the
        Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft.
        <br>
        <br>

        <b>5. Cookies</b><br>
        We don’t normally use cookies on our Web site, but in certain exceptional cases we may use cookies which
        place technical session-control data in your browser’s memory. These data are automatically erased at
        the latest when you close your browser.
        <br>
        If, exceptionally, one of our applications requires the storage of personal data in a cookie, for
        instance a user ID, we will point out you to it.
        <br>
        Of course, it is perfectly possible to consult our Web site without the use of cookies. Please note,
        however, that most browsers are programmed to accept cookies in their de-fault configuration. You can
        prevent this by changing the appropriate setting in the browser options. If you set the browser to
        refuse all cookies, this may restrict your use of certain functions on our Website
        <br>
        <br>

        <b>6. Web analysis</b><br>
        Personal user profiles are not created. However, Section 15 (3) of the Telemedia Act (TMG) permits the
        use of user profiles under a pseudonym for the purpose of advertising, market research and the
        structuring of offers in line with the user's needs provided that the user does not object to this:
        <br>
        We also use web analysis services on our web pages, for example from etracker or WiredMinds, which carry
        out the web analysis on our behalf as contract processors (see the websites of www.wiredminds.de for
        these providers). Their services have been checked by the supervisory authorities and/or experts and
        meet all requirements under German and European data protection laws.
        <br>
        Using the technologies of these providers, data is collected and stored on our website. From this data,
        user profiles are produced under a pseudonym for marketing and optimi-zation purposes, for which cookies
        may be used. Cookies are small text files that are stored locally in the cache memory of the site
        visitor's web browser. The cookies enable the web browser to be recognized. Furthermore, your user
        behavior can be measured via a JavaScript code and data collected in this connection can be sent
        directly to the provider's servers in Germany or the EU via an HTML connection. Without your express
        consent, the data collected using the tracking technologies will not be used to personally identify you
        and will not be combined with the personal data about the bearer of the pseudonym. No cross-website
        analysis will be carried out either.
        <br>
        <br> If you wish to technically stop the tracking, you can deactivate JavaScript and cookies in your web
        browser. Consent for the collection and storage of data can also be refused with effect for the future
        at any time. Please follow this link to refuse the service provided by WiredMinds:
        <a href="http://wm.wiredminds.de">http://wm.wiredminds.de.</a>
        <br>
        <br>

        <b>7. Social plugins</b><br>
        We also use social plugins in some cases on our webpages, e.g. from the Facebook, Twit-ter, YouTube or
        Google+ social networks. These are often technically operated in the USA or in other countries outside
        Germany and the EU and some are offered via national companies in the EU (see the websites
        www.facebook.de, www.twitter.de, www.youtube.de or www.google.de for the providers). The plugins are
        identified with the companies’ logo, comment fields or what are known as a “Like” or “+1” button.
        <br>
        If you open a page of our website in your web browser containing such a plugin, your web browser will
        create a direct connection to the servers of the respective provider in the country concerned.
        <br>
        By incorporating the plugins the provider is given at the least the information that you have visited a
        certain page on our website, and perhaps also other information that your web browser or the device you
        use also discloses. The content of the plugin is loaded by your web browser directly from the provider
        and incorporated into our website. If you are registered and have logged in with the provider concerned,
        your visit can also be assigned to your user account.
        <br>
        If you interact with a plugin, e.g. if you click on the “Like” button or enter a comment in a form
        field, your browser will also transmit this information directly to the provider where it will be saved
        and, if applicable, continue to be used and published.
        <br>
        Above all, marketing measures of the provider and the Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft are the reason for the
        collection and use of the data as described and determine the extent of this. You can find details on
        this and on your rights and on ways in which you can pre-vent the collection and use of your data in
        order to protect your private sphere directly in the data privacy policy of the respective provider.
        <br>
        If you do not wish a provider to collect data on you through our website you must deacti-vate the
        plugins in your web browser. If you wish to avoid a link to any existing user account, you must log out
        before your visit to our website. By visiting our website, you de-clare your consent to the above
        provisions.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>8. Security </b><br>
        The Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft implements technical and organizational security measures to safeguard
        stored personal data against inadvertent or deliberate manipulation, loss or destruction and against
        access by unauthorized persons. Our security measures are continuously im-proved in line with
        technological progress.
        <br><br>
        <b>9. Links to Web sites operated by other providers</b><br>
        Our Web pages may contain links to other providers’ Web pages. We would like to point out that this
        statement of data protection conditions applies exclusively to the Web pages managed by the
        Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft. We have no way of influencing the practices of other providers with respect to
        data protection, nor do we carry out any checks to ensure that they conform with the relevant
        legislation.
        <br><br>
        <b>10. Right to information and contact data</b><br>
        You have a legal right to inspect any stored data concerning your person, and also the right to demand
        their correction or deletion, and to withdraw your consent for their further use.
        <br>
        In some cases, if you are a registered user of certain services provided by the Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft,
        we offer you the possibility of inspecting these data online, and even of deleting or modifying the data
        yourself, via a user account.
        <br>
        If you wish to obtain information on your personal data, or want us to correct or erase such data, or if
        you have any other questions concerning the use of personal data held by us, please contact: <a
              href="mailto:data-protection@zv.fraunhofer.de">data-protection@zv.fraunhofer.de</a>
        <br><br>
        <b>11. Acceptance, validity and modification of data protection conditions</b><br>
        By using our Web site, you implicitly agree to accept the use of your personal data as specified above.
        This present statement of data protection conditions came into effect on October 1st, 2013. As our Web
        site evolves, and new technologies come into use, it may become necessary to amend the statement of data
        protection conditions. The Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft reserves the right to modify its data protection
        conditions at any time, with effect as of a future date. We recommend that you reread the latest version
        from time to time.
