                          <h1 id="autoscaling-engine">AutoScaling Engine</h1>
<p>This external component provides an NFV-compliant AutoScaling Engine (ASE). In the following fundamentals are described such as installing the ASE, configuring it and how to use it such as creating AutoScaling policies.</p>
<p>The <code>autoscaling-engine</code> is implemented in java using the <a href="https://spring.io/">spring.io</a> framework. It runs as an external component and communicates with the NFVO via Open Baton's SDK.</p>
<p>Additionally, the AutoScaling Engine uses the plugin mechanism to allow whatever Monitoring System you prefer. We use <a href="http://www.zabbix.com/">Zabbix</a> as the monitoring system in the following that must be preinstalled and configured. Additional information about <a href="http://openbaton.github.io/documentation/zabbix-plugin/">zabbix-plugin</a> can be found <a href="http://openbaton.github.io/documentation/zabbix-plugin/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Before starting this component you have to do the configuration of the AutoScaling Engine that is described in the <a href="#manual-configuration-of-the-autoscaling-engine">next chapter</a> followed by the guide of <a href="#starting-the-autoscaling-engine">how to start</a> and <a href="#how-to-use-the-autoscaling-engine">how to use</a> it.</p>
<h1 id="technical-requirements">Technical Requirements</h1>
<ul>
<li>Preconfigured Open Baton environment (NFVO, VNFMs, VIM drivers)</li>
<li>Running Zabbix server (if Zabbix is the monitoring system of choice) </li>
<li>Preconfgiured and running zabbix plugin <strong>EITHER</strong> located in the folder <code>NFVO/plugins</code> <strong>OR</strong> <code>autoscaling/plugins</code> to let it start automatically; or started manually. (if Zabbix is the monitoring system of choice)</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="how-to-install-autoscaling-engine">How to install AutoScaling Engine</h1>
<p>If you have the bootstrap procedure and selected the installation of the ASE component, you could skip this section, and move to the <a href="#how-to">How to use AutoScaling Engine</a> one. </p>
<p>Otherwise, please continue with this section. Different options are available for the installation of the AutoScaling Engine. Either you use the fully automated bootstrap where all configurations are done automatically choosing between either the debian based installation or the source code one.
In case you don't use the bootstrap procedure, you can still install the ASE component individually either via apt-get or gradle. </p>
<h2 id="installation-via-bootstrap">Installation via bootstrap</h2>
<p>Using the bootstrap gives a fully automated installation of this component including installation and configuration. If you use the bootstrap you should place your monitoring plugin of choice directly in the <code>NFVO/plugins</code> folder before starting the orchestrator to have it already available when starting the AutoScaling Engine.</p>
<p>The only thing to do is to execute the following command and follow the configuration process: </p>
<pre><code class="bash">bash &lt;(curl -fsSkl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openbaton/autoscaling-engine/master/bootstrap)
</code></pre>

<p>Once you started the bootstrap you can choose between different options, such as installing this component via debian packages or via the source code (mainly for development)</p>
<h2 id="installation-via-debian-package">Installation via debian package</h2>
<p>When using the debian package you need to add the apt-repository of Open Baton to your local environment with the following command if not yet done:</p>
<pre><code class="bash">wget -O - http://get.openbaton.org/keys/public.gpg.key | apt-key add -
echo &quot;deb http://get.openbaton.org/repos/apt/debian/ stable main&quot; &gt;&gt; /etc/apt/sources.list
</code></pre>

<p>Once you added the repo to your environment you should update the list of repos by executing:</p>
<pre><code class="bash">apt-get update
</code></pre>

<p>Now you can install the NSE by executing:</p>
<pre><code class="bash">apt-get install openbaton-ase
</code></pre>

<h2 id="installation-from-the-source-code">Installation from the source code</h2>
<p>The latest version of the AutoScaling Engine can be cloned from this <a href="https://github.com/openbaton/autoscaling">repository</a> by executing the following command:</p>
<pre><code class="bash">git clone https://github.com/openbaton/autoscaling.git
</code></pre>

<p>Once this is done, go inside the cloned folder and make use of the provided script to compile the project and start as done below:</p>
<pre><code class="bash">./autoscaling-engine.sh compile start
</code></pre>

<h1 id="manual-configuration-of-the-autoscaling-engine">Manual configuration of the AutoScaling Engine</h1>
<p>This chapter describes what needs to be done before starting the AutoScaling Engine. This includes the configuration file and properties, and also how to make use of monitoring plugin.</p>
<h2 id="configuration-file">Configuration file</h2>
<p>The configuration file must be copied to <code>etc/openbaton/openbaton-ase.properties</code> by executing the following command from inside the repository folder:</p>
<pre><code class="bash">cp src/main/resources/application.properties /etc/openbaton/openbaton-ase.properties
</code></pre>

<p>If done, check out the following chapter in order to understand the configuration parameters.</p>
<h2 id="configuration-properties">Configuration properties</h2>

<h2 id="monitoring-plugin">Monitoring plugin</h2>
<p>The montoring plugin must be placed in the folder <code>plugins</code>. The zabbix plugin can be found <a href="http://openbaton.github.io/documentation/zabbix-plugin/">here</a> with additional information about how to use and how to compile it.
If the plugin is placed in the folder mentioned before, it will be started automatically when starting the AutoScaling Engine. Additionally, you can place the plugin also in the <code>NFVO/plugins</code> folder to let it start automatically. </p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> If the NFVO is already in charge of starting the plugin, you should avoid to start it a second time from the AutoScaling Engine. Once started it can be used by all components.</p>
<h1 id="starting-the-autoscaling-engine">Starting the AutoScaling Engine</h1>
<p>How to start the ASE depends on the way you installed this component.</p>
<h3 id="debian-packages">Debian packages</h3>
<p>If you installed the ASE with the debian packages you can start it with the following command:</p>
<pre><code class="bash">openbaton-ase start
</code></pre>

<p>For stopping it you can just type:</p>
<pre><code class="bash">openbaton-ase stop
</code></pre>

<h3 id="source-code">Source code</h3>
<p>If you are using the source code you can start the ASE easily by using the provided script with the following command:</p>
<pre><code class="bash">./autoscaling-engine.sh start
</code></pre>

<p>Once the AutoScaling Engine is started, you can access the screen session by executing:</p>
<pre><code class="bash">screen -r openbaton
</code></pre>

<p>For stopping you can use:</p>
<pre><code class="bash">./autoscaling-engine.sh kill
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Note</strong> Since the AutoScaling Engine subscribes to specific events towards the NFVO, you should take care about that the NFVO is already running when starting the AutoScaling Engine. Otherwise, the AutoScaling Engine will wait for 600 seconds for the availability of the NFVO before terminating automatically.</p>
<h1 id="how-to-use-the-autoscaling-engine"><a name="how-to"></a> How to use the AutoScaling Engine</h1>
<p>This guide shows you how to make use of the AutoScaling Engine. In particular, it describes how to define AutoScaling Policies.</p>
<h2 id="creating-autoscaling-policies">Creating AutoScaling Policies</h2>
<p>A AutoScaling Policy defines conditions and actions in order to allow automatic scaling at runtime. The list of AutoScalePolicies are defined at the level of the VNFD/VNFR.
An example of an AutoScalePolicy can be found below followed by descriptions for each parameter.</p>
<pre><code class="json">&quot;auto_scale_policy&quot;:[
  {
    &quot;name&quot;:&quot;scale-out&quot;,
    &quot;threshold&quot;:100,
    &quot;comparisonOperator&quot;:&quot;&gt;=&quot;,
    &quot;period&quot;:30,
    &quot;cooldown&quot;:60,
    &quot;mode&quot;:&quot;REACTIVE&quot;,
    &quot;type&quot;:&quot;WEIGHTED&quot;,
    &quot;alarms&quot;: [
      {
        &quot;metric&quot;:&quot;system.cpu.load[percpu,avg1]&quot;,
        &quot;statistic&quot;:&quot;avg&quot;,
        &quot;comparisonOperator&quot;:&quot;&gt;&quot;,
        &quot;threshold&quot;:0.70,
        &quot;weight&quot;:1
      }
    ],
    &quot;actions&quot;: [
      {
        &quot;type&quot;:&quot;SCALE_OUT&quot;,
        &quot;value&quot;:&quot;2&quot;,
        &quot;target&quot;:&quot;&lt;target&gt;&quot;
      }
    ]
  }
]
</code></pre>

<p>An example using the <strong>TOSCA YAML descriptors</strong> can be found <a href="../tosca-asp/">here</a>.</p>
<p>This AutoScalePolicy indicates a scaling-out operation of two new VNFC Instances if the averaged value of all measurement results of the metric <code>cpu load</code> is greater than the threshold of 0.7 (70%).
This condition is checked every 30 seconds as defined via the period. Once the scaling-out is finished it starts a cooldown of 60 seconds. For this cooldown time further scaling requests are rejected by the AutoScaling Engine.</p>
<p>The following table describes the meanings of the parameters more in detail.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Params</th>
<th>Meaning</th>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>name</td>
<td>This is the human-readable name of the AutoScalePolicy used for identification.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>threshold</td>
<td>Is a value in percentage that indicates how many sub alarms have to be fired before firing the high-alarm of the AutoScalePolicy. For example, a value of 100 indicates that all sub alarms have to be fired in order to execute the actions of this AutoScalePolicy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>comparisonOperator</td>
<td>This comparison operator is used to check the percentages of thrown alarms. 100% means that all weighted alarms must be thrown. 50% would mean that only half of the weighted alarms must be thrown in oder to trigger the scaling action.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>period</td>
<td>This is the period of checking conditions of AutoScalePolicies. For example, a value of 30 indicates, that every 30 seconds all the conditions of the defined AutoScalePolicy are checked.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>cooldown</td>
<td>This is the amount of time the VNF needs to wait between two scaling operations to ensure that the executed scaling action takes effect. Further scaling actions that are requested during the cooldown period are rejected.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>mode</td>
<td>This defines the mode of the AutoScalePolicy. This is mainly about the way of recognizing alarms and conditions, like: <code>REACTIVE</code>, <code>PROACTIVE</code>, <code>PREDICTIVE</code>. At this moment <code>REACTIVE</code> is provided only.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>type</td>
<td>The type defines the meaning and the way of processing alarms. Here we distinguish between <code>VOTED</code>, <code>WEIGHTED</code>, <code>SIMPLE</code>. Currently supported is <code>WEIGHTED</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>alarms</td>
<td>The list of alarms defines all the alarms and conditions that belongs to the same AutoScalePolicy. The list of alarms is affected by the mode and the type of the AutoScalePolicy and influences the final check towards the threshold that decides about the triggering of the AutoScalePolicy. Each alarm is composed as defined <a href="#alarms">here</a>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

          <b>How We Use Cookies?</b>
          <br>
          We use cookies for a variety of reasons detailed below. Unfortunately is most cases there are no
          industry standard options for disabling cookies without completely disabling the functionality and
          features they add to this site. It is recommended that you leave on all cookies if you are not sure
          whether you need them or not in case they are used to provide a service that you use.
          Disabling Cookies

          In some special cases we also use cookies provided by trusted third parties. The following section
          details which third party cookies you might encounter through this site.
          <br>
          This site uses Google Analytics which is one of the most widespread and trusted analytics solution
          on the web for helping us to understand how you use the site and ways that we can improve your
          experience. These cookies may track things such as how long you spend on the site and the pages that
          you visit so we can continue to produce engaging content.
          <br>
          For more information on Google Analytics cookies, see the <a
                href="https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/cookie-usage">official
          Google Analytics page</a>.
          <br>
          From time to time we test new features and make subtle changes to the way that the site is
          delivered. When we are still testing new features these cookies may be used to ensure that you

        <p>
          The Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft zur Förderung der angewandten Forschung e.V. (Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft)
          takes the protection of your personal data very seriously. When we process the personal data that is
          collected during your visits to our Web site, we always observe the rules laid down in the
          applicable data protection laws. Your data will not be disclosed publicly by us, nor transferred to
          any third parties without your consent.
          <br>
          <br>

          <b>1. Recording and processing of data in connection with access over the Internet</b><br>
          When you visit our Web site, our Web server makes a temporary record of each access and stores it in
          a log file. The following data are recorded, and stored until an automatic deletion date:
        <ul>
          <li>IP address of the requesting processor</li>
          <li>Date and time of access</li>
          <li>Name and URL of the downloaded file</li>
          <li>Volume of data transmitted</li>
          <li>Indication whether download was successful</li>
          <li>Data identifying the browser software and operating system</li>
          <li>Web site from which our site was accessed</li>
          <li>Name of your Internet service provider</li>
        </ul>
        The purpose of recording these data is to allow use of the Web site (connection setup), for system
        security, for technical administration of the network infrastructure and in order to op-timize our
        Internet service. The IP address is only evaluated in the event of fraudulent access to the network
        infrastructure of the Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft.
        <br>
        Apart from the special cases cited above, we do not process personal data without first obtaining your
        explicit consent to do so. Pseudonymous user profiles can be created as stated under web analysis (see
        below).

        <br>
        <br>
        <b>​2. Orders</b><br>
        If you order information material or other goods via our website, we will use the address data provided
        only for the purpose of processing your order.

        <br>
        <br>
        <b>3. Use and transfer of personal data</b><br>
        All use of your personal data is confined to the purposes stated above, and is only under-taken to the
        extent necessary for these purposes. Your data is not disclosed to third parties.
        <br>
        Personal data will not be transferred to government bodies or public authorities except in order to
        comply with mandatory national legislation or if the transfer of such data should be necessary in order
        to take legal action in cases of fraudulent access to our network infrastructure. Personal data will not
        be transferred for any other purpose.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>4. Consent to use data in other contexts</b><br>

        The use of certain services on our website, such as newsletters or discussion forums, may re-quire prior
        registration and involves a more substantial processing of personal data, such as longer-term storage of
        e-mail addresses, user IDs and passwords. We use such data only insofar as it has been sent to us by you
        in person and you have given us your express prior consent for this use. For example, we request your
        consent separately in the following cases:
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>4.1 Newsletters and press distribution</b><br>

        In order to register for a newsletter service provided by the Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft, we need at least
        your e-mail address so that we know where to send the newsletter. All other information you supply is on
        a voluntary basis, and will be only if you give your consent, for example to contact you directly or
        clear up questions concerning your e-mail address. If you request delivery by post, we need your postal
        address. If you ask to be included on a press distribution list, we need to know which publication you
        work for, to allow us to check whether specific publications are actually receiving our press material.
        <br>
        As a general rule, we employ the double opt-in method for the registration. In other words, after you
        have registered for the service and informed us of your e-mail address, you will receive an e-mail in
        return from us, containing a link that you must use to con-firm your registration. Your registration and
        confirmation will be recorded. The newsletter will not be sent until this has been done. This procedure
        is used to ensure that only you yourself can register with the newsletter service under the specified
        e-mail address. You must confirm your registration as soon as possible after receiving our e-mail,
        otherwise your registration and e-mail address will be erased from our database. Until we receive your
        confirmation, our newsletter service will refuse to accept any other registration re-quests using this
        e-mail address.
        <br>
        You can cancel subscriptions to our newsletters at any time. To do so, either send us an e-mail or
        follow the link at the end of the newsletter.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>​4.2 Visitors’ books and forums</b><br>
        If you wish to sign up for an Internet forum run by the Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft, we need at least a user
        ID, a password, and your e-mail address. For your own protection, the reg-istration procedure for this
        type of service, like that for the newsletters, involves you con-firming your request using the link
        contained in the e-mail we send you and you giving your consent to the use of further personal data
        where this is necessary to use the forum.
        <br>
        You can cancel your registration for this type of service at any time, by sending us an e-mail via the
        Web page offering the service.
        <br>
        As a general rule, the content of visitors’ books and forums is not subject to any form of monitoring by
        the Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft. Nevertheless, we reserve the right to delete posted contributions and to
        prohibit users from further use of the service at our own dis-cretion, especially in cases where posted
        content contravenes the law or is deemed in-compatible with the objectives of the
        Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft.
        <br>
        <br>

        <b>5. Cookies</b><br>
        We don’t normally use cookies on our Web site, but in certain exceptional cases we may use cookies which
        place technical session-control data in your browser’s memory. These data are automatically erased at
        the latest when you close your browser.
        <br>
        If, exceptionally, one of our applications requires the storage of personal data in a cookie, for
        instance a user ID, we will point out you to it.
        <br>
        Of course, it is perfectly possible to consult our Web site without the use of cookies. Please note,
        however, that most browsers are programmed to accept cookies in their de-fault configuration. You can
        prevent this by changing the appropriate setting in the browser options. If you set the browser to
        refuse all cookies, this may restrict your use of certain functions on our Website
        <br>
        <br>

        <b>6. Web analysis</b><br>
        Personal user profiles are not created. However, Section 15 (3) of the Telemedia Act (TMG) permits the
        use of user profiles under a pseudonym for the purpose of advertising, market research and the
        structuring of offers in line with the user's needs provided that the user does not object to this:
        <br>
        We also use web analysis services on our web pages, for example from etracker or WiredMinds, which carry
        out the web analysis on our behalf as contract processors (see the websites of www.wiredminds.de for
        these providers). Their services have been checked by the supervisory authorities and/or experts and
        meet all requirements under German and European data protection laws.
        <br>
        Using the technologies of these providers, data is collected and stored on our website. From this data,
        user profiles are produced under a pseudonym for marketing and optimi-zation purposes, for which cookies
        may be used. Cookies are small text files that are stored locally in the cache memory of the site
        visitor's web browser. The cookies enable the web browser to be recognized. Furthermore, your user
        behavior can be measured via a JavaScript code and data collected in this connection can be sent
        directly to the provider's servers in Germany or the EU via an HTML connection. Without your express
        consent, the data collected using the tracking technologies will not be used to personally identify you
        and will not be combined with the personal data about the bearer of the pseudonym. No cross-website
        analysis will be carried out either.
        <br>
        <br> If you wish to technically stop the tracking, you can deactivate JavaScript and cookies in your web
        browser. Consent for the collection and storage of data can also be refused with effect for the future
        at any time. Please follow this link to refuse the service provided by WiredMinds:
        <a href="http://wm.wiredminds.de">http://wm.wiredminds.de.</a>
        <br>
        <br>

        <b>7. Social plugins</b><br>
        We also use social plugins in some cases on our webpages, e.g. from the Facebook, Twit-ter, YouTube or
        Google+ social networks. These are often technically operated in the USA or in other countries outside
        Germany and the EU and some are offered via national companies in the EU (see the websites
        www.facebook.de, www.twitter.de, www.youtube.de or www.google.de for the providers). The plugins are
        identified with the companies’ logo, comment fields or what are known as a “Like” or “+1” button.
        <br>
        If you open a page of our website in your web browser containing such a plugin, your web browser will
        create a direct connection to the servers of the respective provider in the country concerned.
        <br>
        By incorporating the plugins the provider is given at the least the information that you have visited a
        certain page on our website, and perhaps also other information that your web browser or the device you
        use also discloses. The content of the plugin is loaded by your web browser directly from the provider
        and incorporated into our website. If you are registered and have logged in with the provider concerned,
        your visit can also be assigned to your user account.
        <br>
        If you interact with a plugin, e.g. if you click on the “Like” button or enter a comment in a form
        field, your browser will also transmit this information directly to the provider where it will be saved
        and, if applicable, continue to be used and published.
        <br>
        Above all, marketing measures of the provider and the Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft are the reason for the
        collection and use of the data as described and determine the extent of this. You can find details on
        this and on your rights and on ways in which you can pre-vent the collection and use of your data in
        order to protect your private sphere directly in the data privacy policy of the respective provider.
        <br>
        If you do not wish a provider to collect data on you through our website you must deacti-vate the
        plugins in your web browser. If you wish to avoid a link to any existing user account, you must log out
        before your visit to our website. By visiting our website, you de-clare your consent to the above
        provisions.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>8. Security </b><br>
        The Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft implements technical and organizational security measures to safeguard
        stored personal data against inadvertent or deliberate manipulation, loss or destruction and against
        access by unauthorized persons. Our security measures are continuously im-proved in line with
        technological progress.
        <br><br>
        <b>9. Links to Web sites operated by other providers</b><br>
        Our Web pages may contain links to other providers’ Web pages. We would like to point out that this
        statement of data protection conditions applies exclusively to the Web pages managed by the
        Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft. We have no way of influencing the practices of other providers with respect to
        data protection, nor do we carry out any checks to ensure that they conform with the relevant
        legislation.
        <br><br>
        <b>10. Right to information and contact data</b><br>
        You have a legal right to inspect any stored data concerning your person, and also the right to demand
        their correction or deletion, and to withdraw your consent for their further use.
        <br>
        In some cases, if you are a registered user of certain services provided by the Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft,
        we offer you the possibility of inspecting these data online, and even of deleting or modifying the data
        yourself, via a user account.
        <br>
        If you wish to obtain information on your personal data, or want us to correct or erase such data, or if
        you have any other questions concerning the use of personal data held by us, please contact: <a
              href="mailto:data-protection@zv.fraunhofer.de">data-protection@zv.fraunhofer.de</a>
        <br><br>
        <b>11. Acceptance, validity and modification of data protection conditions</b><br>
        By using our Web site, you implicitly agree to accept the use of your personal data as specified above.
        This present statement of data protection conditions came into effect on October 1st, 2013. As our Web
        site evolves, and new technologies come into use, it may become necessary to amend the statement of data
        protection conditions. The Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft reserves the right to modify its data protection
        conditions at any time, with effect as of a future date. We recommend that you reread the latest version
        from time to time.
