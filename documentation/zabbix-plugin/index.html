<p>Zabbix plugin (see it on <a href="https://github.com/openbaton/zabbix-plugin">GitHub</a>) is an open source project providing a reference implementation of two interfaces of the VIM, based on the ETSI <a href="http://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_gs/NFV-MAN/001_099/001/01.01.01_60/gs_nfv-man001v010101p.pdf">NFV MANO</a> specification.</p>
<p>The two interfaces are:<br />
-   VirtualisedResourceFaultManagement<br />
-   VirtualisedResourcePerformanceManagement</p>
<p>A detailed description of the interfaces is in the ETSI <a href="http://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_gs/NFV-IFA/001_099/005/02.01.01_60/gs_nfv-ifa005v020101p.pdf">IFA005_Or-Vi_ref_point_Spec</a>.<br />
In particular with the Zabbix plugin you can create/delete items, trigger and action on-demand. </p>
<p><img alt="Zabbix plugin architecture" src="../images/zabbix-plugin-architecture.png" /></p>
<p>Some of the benefits introduced by the usage of such plugin:<br />
1) Make the consumers (NFVO, VNF managers, Fault Management System, AutoScaling Engine) independent to the monitoring system.<br />
2) The communication between the consumers and Zabbix Plugin is JSON based, so the consumers can be written in any languages.<br />
3) The values of the items are cached and updated periodically in order to avoid to contact the Zabbix Server each time a specific metric is required.</p>
<h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>
<p>The prerequisites are:  </p>
<ul>
<li>Zabbix server (2.2 or 3.0) installed and running. See <a href="../zabbix-server-configuration-2.2/">how to configure Zabbix server 2.2</a> or <a href="../zabbix-server-configuration-3.0/">Zabbix server 3.0</a>.</li>
<li>Open Baton NFVO up and running</li>
<li>Git installed</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="set-up-environment">Set up environment</h2>
<p>Create and give the right permissions to the folder which will host the configuration file:</p>
<pre><code class="bash">sudo mkdir -p /etc/openbaton
sudo chwon -R $USER: /etc/openbaton
</code></pre>

<p>The Zabbix Plugin logs at default in the file <strong>/var/log/openbaton/openbaton-plugin-monitoring-zabbix.log</strong>. Create and give the right permissions in that folder running the command:</p>
<pre><code class="bash">sudo mkdir -p /var/log/openbaton

</code></pre>

<h2 id="additional-zabbix-server-configuration-required-for-receiving-notifications">Additional Zabbix Server configuration required for receiving notifications</h2>
<p>If you are going to use Open Baton FM system or you wish to use the createThreshold method, you need this additional configuration.<br />
Create a script called "send_notification.sh" with the following content.</p>
<pre><code class="bash">#!/bin/bash
to=$1
body=$3
curl -X POST -H &quot;Accept: application/json&quot; -H &quot;Content-Type: application/json&quot; -d &quot;$body&quot; http://$to
</code></pre>

<p>The variable 'to' is the endpoint where zabbix-plugin receives the notification (specified in <strong>notification-receiver-server-context</strong> property). 
Copy the following script in the Zabbix Server machine. In particular, in a special directory defined in the Zabbix Server configuration file (/etc/zabbix/zabbix_server.conf) as AlertScriptsPath variable. If the value of the variable AlertScriptsPath is for example "/usr/lib/zabbix/alertscripts", 
then copy the send_notification.sh script just created in that folder.<br />
Once you are in the directory "/usr/lib/zabbix/alertscripts", add executable permissions to the script running the command:</p>
<pre><code class="bash">sudo chmod +x send_notification.sh
</code></pre>

<p><em>Note</em>: when you will use the method createThreshold, Zabbix Plugin will configure Zabbix Server automatically in order to use the script "send_notification.sh". 
What it will try to do is the configuration at this page <a href="https://www.zabbix.com/documentation/2.2/manual/config/notifications/media/script">custom alertscripts</a>. 
If for any reason this auto-configuration won't work, you will see in the Zabbix Plugin logs, then you should execute this configuration manually as explained in the Zabbix documentation.</p>
<h2 id="run-the-zabbix-plugin">Run the Zabbix Plugin</h2>
<p>Simply run the jar with:</p>
<pre><code class="bash">java -jar build/lib/openbaton-plugin-monitoring-zabbix-&lt;version&gt;.jar
</code></pre>

<p>Check the logs in /var/log/openbaton/openbaton-plugin-monitoring-zabbix.log</p>
<h2 id="notification-mechanism">Notification mechanism</h2>
<p>How does Zabbix plugin receive notifications from the Zabbix Server? </p>
<p>When using the method createThreshold provided by the plugin, it automatically creates an <a href="https://www.zabbix.com/documentation/2.2/manual/config/notifications/action">action</a> executed when the specific condition is met. 
If the threshold is crossed (the status of the trigger goes from OK to PROBLEM or viceversa) the action is performed. The action gets the informations of the threshold and sends them to a custom alertScript.
The custom alertscripts is executed on the Zabbix Server and its task is to send the information received from the action to the Zabbix plugin. </p>
<p>Zabbix plugin waits for notifications at the url: http://zabbix-plugin-ip:defaultPort/defaultContext.</p>
<p>Default context and ports are specified in the configuration file as: 
<em> <strong>notification-receiver-server-context</strong>.
</em> <strong>notification-receiver-server-port</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="using-it-via-monitoringplugincaller">Using it via MonitoringPluginCaller</h2>
<p>In order to use the MonitorPluginCaller you need to import the relative plugin-sdk, coming from <a href="http://openbaton.github.io">Openbaton</a> project.
To import the plugin-sdk, please add in your Gradle file the following dependencies:</p>
<pre><code>repositories {
       maven { url 'https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/' }
       maven { url 'https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/releases/'  }
}

dependencies {
    compile 'org.openbaton:monitoring:4.0.0'
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then in your main, obtain the MonitoringPluginCaller as follows:</p>
<pre><code class="java">MonitoringPluginCaller monitoringPluginCaller = null;
    try {
      monitoringPluginCaller =
          new MonitoringPluginCaller(
              rabbitmqIp,
              rabbitmqUsr,
              rabbitmqPwd,
              5672,
              &quot;zabbix-plugin&quot;,
              &quot;zabbix&quot;,
              &quot;15672&quot;,
              120000);
    } catch (Exception e) {
      e.printStackTrace();

<pre><code class="java">String createPMJob(ObjectSelection selector, List&lt;String&gt; performanceMetrics, List&lt;String&gt; performanceMetricGroup, Integer collectionPeriod,Integer reportingPeriod) throws MonitoringException;
</code></pre>

<p>This method create one or more items to be monitored in one or more hosts.</p>
<p><strong>selector</strong>: object to select the hosts in which we want to add the items.</p>
<p><strong>performanceMetrics</strong>: List of items. We can create items which are available in the <a href="https://www.zabbix.com/documentation/2.2/manual/config/items/itemtypes/zabbix_agent">Zabbix documentation 2.2</a> or <a href="https://www.zabbix.com/documentation/3.0/manual/config/items/itemtypes/zabbix_agent">Zabbix documentation 3.0</a>.</p>
<p><strong>performanceMetricGroup</strong>: pre-defined list of metrics. (NOT YET IMPLEMENTED, please pass an empty list of string).</p>
<p><strong>collectionPeriod</strong>: Update interval of the item/s in seconds.</p>
<p><strong>reportingPeriod</strong>: Specifies the periodicity at which the VIM will report to the customers about performance information. (NOT YET IMPLEMENTED, please pass an integer &gt;= 0 ).</p>
<p>In the following example we create two items ('net.tcp.listen[8080]' and 'agent.ping') for two hosts ('host-1' and 'host-2'). As a return value we get the ID of the PMJob.</p>
<pre><code class="java">ObjectSelection objectSelection = getObjectSelector(&quot;host-1&quot;,&quot;host-2&quot;);
List&lt;String&gt; performanceMetrics = getPerformanceMetrics(&quot;net.tcp.listen[8080]&quot;,&quot;agent.ping&quot;);
String pmJobId = monitoringPluginCaller.createPMJob(objectSelection, performanceMetrics, new ArrayList&lt;String&gt;(),60, 0);
System.out.println(&quot;PmJobId is: &quot;+pmJobId);
</code></pre>

<p>Here the methods getObjectSelector and getPerformanceMetrics:</p>
<pre><code class="java">private List&lt;String&gt; getPerformanceMetrics(String ... performanceMetrics) {
    List&lt;String&gt; result = new ArrayList&lt;String&gt;();
    for(String performanceMetric : performanceMetrics){
        result.add(performanceMetric);
    }
    return result;
}

private ObjectSelection getObjectSelector(String ... hosts) {
    ObjectSelection objectSelection = new ObjectSelection();
    for(String host : hosts){
        objectSelection.addObjectInstanceId(host);
    }
    return objectSelection;
}
</code></pre>

<h4 id="delete-pm-job">Delete Pm Job</h4>
<pre><code class="java">List&lt;String&gt; deletePMJob(List&lt;String&gt; pmJobIdsToDelete) throws MonitoringException;
</code></pre>

<p>This method delete an existing PmJob. We can get the id of the PmJob after the creation with createPMJob. As a return value we get the ID of the PMJobs effectively deleted.</p>
<h4 id="query-pm-job">Query Pm Job</h4>
<pre><code class="java">List&lt;Item&gt; queryPMJob(List&lt;String&gt; hostnames, List&lt;String&gt; performanceMetrics, String period) throws MonitoringException;
</code></pre>

<p>This method get item values from one or more host. As a return value we get the list of items.</p>
<p><strong>hostnames</strong>: list of hostnames which we want to know items values.</p>
<p><strong>performanceMetrics</strong>: List of items. We can get items which are available in: the <a href="https://www.zabbix.com/documentation/2.2/manual/config/items/itemtypes/zabbix_agent">Zabbix documentation 2.2</a>, <a href="https://www.zabbix.com/documentation/3.0/manual/config/items/itemtypes/zabbix_agent">Zabbix documentation 3.0</a>, and in the <strong>hostnames</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>period</strong>: period in seconds. If period is 0 than you get the last available value of the item. If &gt; 0 you get the average of the values inside that period.
    Remember than the zabbix-plugin read all value of the all hosts every <strong>client-request-frequency</strong> (see the configuration section) and keep them in the history.
    So if <strong>client-request-frequency</strong> is 15 seconds and the period 30 seconds you get the average of the previous 2 values of the item.</p>
<p>In the following example we ask for the last value of two items ('net.tcp.listen[8080]' and 'agent.ping') for the hosts 'host-1'.</p>
<pre><code class="java">ArrayList&lt;String&gt; hostnames = getHostnames(&quot;host-1&quot;);
ArrayList&lt;String&gt; performanceMetrics = getPerformanceMetrics(&quot;net.tcp.listen[8080]&quot;,&quot;agent.ping&quot;);
List&lt;Item&gt; items = monitoringPluginCaller.queryPMJob(hostnames,performanceMetrics,&quot;0&quot;);

<h4 id="create-threshold">Create Threshold</h4>
<pre><code class="java">String createThreshold(ObjectSelection selector, String performanceMetric, ThresholdType thresholdType, ThresholdDetails thresholdDetails) throws MonitoringException;
</code></pre>

<p>This method create a trigger on a specific item for one or more hosts. As a return value we get the id of the threshold.</p>
<p><strong>selector</strong>: object to select the hosts which will be part of the trigger.</p>
<p><strong>performanceMetric</strong>: item to include in the trigger. The item need to be already present in the hosts specified in the <em>selector</em>.</p>
<p><strong>thresholdType</strong>: defines the type of threshold. (NOT YET IMPLEMENTED, please pass ThresholdType.SINGLE for the moment).</p>
<p><strong>thresholdDetails</strong>: details of the threshold. It contains:</p>
<ul>
<li>function: refer to <a href="https://www.zabbix.com/documentation/2.2/manual/appendix/triggers/functions">Zabbix trigger function 2.2</a> or <a href="https://www.zabbix.com/documentation/3.0/manual/appendix/triggers/functions">Zabbix trigger function 3.0</a> </li>
<li>triggerOperator: operator</li>
<li>perceiverSeverity: severity of the trigger.</li>
<li>value: threshold value to compare with the actual value of the <em>performanceMetric</em>.</li>
<li>hostOperator: can be "|" or "&amp;", meaning that the threshold will trigger when at least one host or all the hosts cross the threshold value.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the following example we create a treshold for two hosts ('host-1' and 'host-2').</p>
<pre><code class="java">ObjectSelection objectSelector = getObjectSelector(&quot;host-1&quot;,&quot;host-2&quot;);
ThresholdDetails thresholdDetails= new ThresholdDetails(&quot;last(0)&quot;,&quot;=&quot;,PerceivedSeverity.CRITICAL,&quot;0&quot;,&quot;|&quot;);
String thresholdId = zabbixMonitoringAgent.createThreshold(objectSelector,&quot;net.tcp.listen[5001]&quot;,ThresholdType.SINGLE_VALUE,thresholdDetails);
</code></pre>

<p>The trigger that will be created has this expression: {host-1:net.tcp.listen[5001].last(0)}=0|{host-2:net.tcp.listen[5001].last(0)}=0.
It means that if host-1 OR host-2 have no more process listening on the port 5001 then create an alarm with severity critical.
Refer to <a href="https://www.zabbix.com/documentation/2.2/manual/config/triggers/expression">Zabbix expression 2.2</a> or <a href="https://www.zabbix.com/documentation/3.0/manual/config/triggers/expression">Zabbix expression 3.0</a> to understand better the expression.</p>

<p>Subscribe for alarm generated by thresholds. As a return value we get the id of the subscription.
<strong>filter</strong>: AlarmEndpoint object which contains:
-  name: name of the alarmEndpoint.
-  resourceId: hostname which we want to subscribe.
-  type: REST or JMS.
-  endpoint: endpoint where we want to be notified. It is and url for REST or a queue name for JMS. (actually only rest is supported).
-  perceivedSeverity: define the severity of the alarm we want to get.
    If we specify PerceivedSeverity.WARNING we will able to get notification from alarm with severity equals or higher than WARNING.</p>

<p>This method detele the subscription with the ID passed as a argument. As a return value we get the id of the subscription effectively deleted.
We can get the id of the subscription after the creation with subscribeForFault.</p>
<h4 id="get-alarm-list">Get alarm list</h4>
<p>NOT YET IMPLEMENTED</p>
<h4 id="notify">Notify</h4>
<p>This method cannot be invoked by the customers as specified in the ETSI draft <a href="http://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_gs/NFV-IFA/001_099/005/02.01.01_60/gs_nfv-ifa005v020101p.pdf">IFA005_Or-Vi_ref_point_Spec</a>.</p>
<h2 id="zabbix-severity-mapping-with-etsi-severity">Zabbix severity mapping with ETSI severity</h2>
<p>In Zabbix we can specify a severity of a trigger: not classified, information, warning, average, high, disaster.</p>
<p>In the ETSI draft there are different level of severity, called perceived severity: Indeterminate, warning, minor, major, critical.</p>
<p>So the mapping in the zabbix plugin is showed in the following table:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Zabbix severity</th>
<th>ETSI perceived severity</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Not classified</td>
<td>Indeterminate</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Information</td>
<td>Warning</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Warning</td>
<td>Warning</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Average</td>
<td>Minor</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>High</td>
<td>Major</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Disaster</td>
<td>Critical</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h2 id="notifications-types">Notifications types</h2>
<p>When we create a new threshold, we would like to get a notification as soon as the threshold is crossed. Both interfaces send notifications with the method notify.
According to ETSI specification there are 4 types of notifications. </p>
<p>The interface VirtualisedResourcePerformanceManagement sends two types of notifications:  </p>
<ol>
<li>PerformanceInformationAvailableNotification (NOT YET IMPLEMENTED) : this notification informs the receiver that performance information is available.     </li>
<li>hresholdCrossedNotification (NOT YET IMPLEMENTED) : his notification informs the receiver that a threshold value has been crossed.  </li>
</ol>
<p>The interface VirtualisedResourceFaultManagement sends the following notifications:</p>
<ol>
<li>AlarmNotification: This notification informs the receiver of alarms resulting from the faults related to the virtualised resources managed by the VIM. It contains the Alarm with all the information about the fault.</li>
<li>AlarmStateChangedNotification: This notification informs the receiver of state change of alarm related to the virtualised resources managed by the VIM, e.g. the alarm shall be set to “cleared” if the corresponding fault has been solved.
    It contains the id of the Alarm and the actual status which could be (CLEARED,FIRED,UPDATED).</li>
</ol>
<p>Actually the zabbix-plugin when receives the notification by zabbix server, <strong>if the trigger has severity higher than Information</strong>, 
it creates an alarm (mapping zabbix notification into standard Alarm) and notify the subscribers with a AlarmNotification. If the notification is not new, then it sends an AlarmStateChangedNotification.</p>

          <br>
          This site uses Google Analytics which is one of the most widespread and trusted analytics solution
          on the web for helping us to understand how you use the site and ways that we can improve your

        <p>
          The Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft zur Förderung der angewandten Forschung e.V. (Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft)
          takes the protection of your personal data very seriously. When we process the personal data that is
          collected during your visits to our Web site, we always observe the rules laid down in the
          applicable data protection laws. Your data will not be disclosed publicly by us, nor transferred to
          any third parties without your consent.
          <br>
          <br>

          <b>1. Recording and processing of data in connection with access over the Internet</b><br>
          When you visit our Web site, our Web server makes a temporary record of each access and stores it in
          a log file. The following data are recorded, and stored until an automatic deletion date:
        <ul>
          <li>IP address of the requesting processor</li>
          <li>Date and time of access</li>
          <li>Name and URL of the downloaded file</li>
          <li>Volume of data transmitted</li>
          <li>Indication whether download was successful</li>
          <li>Data identifying the browser software and operating system</li>
          <li>Web site from which our site was accessed</li>
          <li>Name of your Internet service provider</li>
        </ul>
        The purpose of recording these data is to allow use of the Web site (connection setup), for system
        security, for technical administration of the network infrastructure and in order to op-timize our
        Internet service. The IP address is only evaluated in the event of fraudulent access to the network
        infrastructure of the Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft.
        <br>
        Apart from the special cases cited above, we do not process personal data without first obtaining your
        explicit consent to do so. Pseudonymous user profiles can be created as stated under web analysis (see
        below).

        <br>
        <br>
        <b>​2. Orders</b><br>
        If you order information material or other goods via our website, we will use the address data provided
        only for the purpose of processing your order.

        <br>
        <br>
        <b>3. Use and transfer of personal data</b><br>
        All use of your personal data is confined to the purposes stated above, and is only under-taken to the
        extent necessary for these purposes. Your data is not disclosed to third parties.
        <br>
        Personal data will not be transferred to government bodies or public authorities except in order to
        comply with mandatory national legislation or if the transfer of such data should be necessary in order
        to take legal action in cases of fraudulent access to our network infrastructure. Personal data will not
        be transferred for any other purpose.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>4. Consent to use data in other contexts</b><br>

        The use of certain services on our website, such as newsletters or discussion forums, may re-quire prior
        registration and involves a more substantial processing of personal data, such as longer-term storage of
        e-mail addresses, user IDs and passwords. We use such data only insofar as it has been sent to us by you
        in person and you have given us your express prior consent for this use. For example, we request your
        consent separately in the following cases:
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>4.1 Newsletters and press distribution</b><br>

        In order to register for a newsletter service provided by the Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft, we need at least
        your e-mail address so that we know where to send the newsletter. All other information you supply is on
        a voluntary basis, and will be only if you give your consent, for example to contact you directly or
        clear up questions concerning your e-mail address. If you request delivery by post, we need your postal
        address. If you ask to be included on a press distribution list, we need to know which publication you
        work for, to allow us to check whether specific publications are actually receiving our press material.
        <br>
        As a general rule, we employ the double opt-in method for the registration. In other words, after you
        have registered for the service and informed us of your e-mail address, you will receive an e-mail in
        return from us, containing a link that you must use to con-firm your registration. Your registration and
        confirmation will be recorded. The newsletter will not be sent until this has been done. This procedure
        is used to ensure that only you yourself can register with the newsletter service under the specified
        e-mail address. You must confirm your registration as soon as possible after receiving our e-mail,
        otherwise your registration and e-mail address will be erased from our database. Until we receive your
        confirmation, our newsletter service will refuse to accept any other registration re-quests using this
        e-mail address.
        <br>
        You can cancel subscriptions to our newsletters at any time. To do so, either send us an e-mail or
        follow the link at the end of the newsletter.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>​4.2 Visitors’ books and forums</b><br>
        If you wish to sign up for an Internet forum run by the Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft, we need at least a user
        ID, a password, and your e-mail address. For your own protection, the reg-istration procedure for this
        type of service, like that for the newsletters, involves you con-firming your request using the link
        contained in the e-mail we send you and you giving your consent to the use of further personal data
        where this is necessary to use the forum.
        <br>
        You can cancel your registration for this type of service at any time, by sending us an e-mail via the
        Web page offering the service.
        <br>
        As a general rule, the content of visitors’ books and forums is not subject to any form of monitoring by
        the Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft. Nevertheless, we reserve the right to delete posted contributions and to
        prohibit users from further use of the service at our own dis-cretion, especially in cases where posted
        content contravenes the law or is deemed in-compatible with the objectives of the
        Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft.
        <br>
        <br>

        <b>5. Cookies</b><br>
        We don’t normally use cookies on our Web site, but in certain exceptional cases we may use cookies which
        place technical session-control data in your browser’s memory. These data are automatically erased at
        the latest when you close your browser.
        <br>
        If, exceptionally, one of our applications requires the storage of personal data in a cookie, for
        instance a user ID, we will point out you to it.
        <br>
        Of course, it is perfectly possible to consult our Web site without the use of cookies. Please note,
        however, that most browsers are programmed to accept cookies in their de-fault configuration. You can
        prevent this by changing the appropriate setting in the browser options. If you set the browser to
        refuse all cookies, this may restrict your use of certain functions on our Website
        <br>
        <br>

        <b>6. Web analysis</b><br>
        Personal user profiles are not created. However, Section 15 (3) of the Telemedia Act (TMG) permits the
        use of user profiles under a pseudonym for the purpose of advertising, market research and the
        structuring of offers in line with the user's needs provided that the user does not object to this:
        <br>
        We also use web analysis services on our web pages, for example from etracker or WiredMinds, which carry
        out the web analysis on our behalf as contract processors (see the websites of www.wiredminds.de for
        these providers). Their services have been checked by the supervisory authorities and/or experts and
        meet all requirements under German and European data protection laws.
        <br>
        Using the technologies of these providers, data is collected and stored on our website. From this data,
        user profiles are produced under a pseudonym for marketing and optimi-zation purposes, for which cookies
        may be used. Cookies are small text files that are stored locally in the cache memory of the site
        visitor's web browser. The cookies enable the web browser to be recognized. Furthermore, your user
        behavior can be measured via a JavaScript code and data collected in this connection can be sent
        directly to the provider's servers in Germany or the EU via an HTML connection. Without your express
        consent, the data collected using the tracking technologies will not be used to personally identify you
        and will not be combined with the personal data about the bearer of the pseudonym. No cross-website
        analysis will be carried out either.
        <br>
        <br> If you wish to technically stop the tracking, you can deactivate JavaScript and cookies in your web
        browser. Consent for the collection and storage of data can also be refused with effect for the future
        at any time. Please follow this link to refuse the service provided by WiredMinds:
        <a href="http://wm.wiredminds.de">http://wm.wiredminds.de.</a>
        <br>
        <br>

        <b>7. Social plugins</b><br>
        We also use social plugins in some cases on our webpages, e.g. from the Facebook, Twit-ter, YouTube or
        Google+ social networks. These are often technically operated in the USA or in other countries outside
        Germany and the EU and some are offered via national companies in the EU (see the websites
        www.facebook.de, www.twitter.de, www.youtube.de or www.google.de for the providers). The plugins are
        identified with the companies’ logo, comment fields or what are known as a “Like” or “+1” button.
        <br>
        If you open a page of our website in your web browser containing such a plugin, your web browser will
        create a direct connection to the servers of the respective provider in the country concerned.
        <br>
        By incorporating the plugins the provider is given at the least the information that you have visited a
        certain page on our website, and perhaps also other information that your web browser or the device you
        use also discloses. The content of the plugin is loaded by your web browser directly from the provider
        and incorporated into our website. If you are registered and have logged in with the provider concerned,
        your visit can also be assigned to your user account.
        <br>
        If you interact with a plugin, e.g. if you click on the “Like” button or enter a comment in a form
        field, your browser will also transmit this information directly to the provider where it will be saved
        and, if applicable, continue to be used and published.
        <br>
        Above all, marketing measures of the provider and the Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft are the reason for the
        collection and use of the data as described and determine the extent of this. You can find details on
        this and on your rights and on ways in which you can pre-vent the collection and use of your data in
        order to protect your private sphere directly in the data privacy policy of the respective provider.
        <br>
        If you do not wish a provider to collect data on you through our website you must deacti-vate the
        plugins in your web browser. If you wish to avoid a link to any existing user account, you must log out
        before your visit to our website. By visiting our website, you de-clare your consent to the above
        provisions.
