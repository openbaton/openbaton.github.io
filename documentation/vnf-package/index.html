<p>This page describes essential components of a VNF Package, how to create them and how to use them after onboarding.
Therefore, you can find a practical tutorial at the end with all the steps starting from the creation over onboarding and finally referencing it in an NSD.</p>
<p>The NFVO supports two different formats for VNF Packages:  </p>
<ul>
<li>TAR archive following the ETSI NFV specification for VNF Descriptors and Packages</li>
<li>CSAR archive following the <a href="https://docs.oasis-open.org/tosca/tosca-nfv/v1.0/tosca-nfv-v1.0.html">Tosca simple profile for NFV</a> specification.</li>
</ul>
<p>This page provides more information about the first option, while more information about the second option are given in this <a href="../tosca-CSAR-onboarding">tutorial</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Important note-1:</strong> in case your scripts are available publicly on GitHub, you may not need the creation of a specific VNF package, but you can just refer them in the VNFD as part of the
<em>vnfPackageLocation</em> parameter</p>
<p><strong>Important note-2:</strong> in case you are using the Docker VIM Driver and Docker VNFM the script folder is not considered, as the docker approach relies on docker images ready to be launched.</p>
<h1 id="overview">Overview</h1>
<p>A VNF Package is a tar-archive containing all the information required for managing the lifecycle of a VNF. First step is to build the archive which then can be onboarded to the NFVO.
A typical VNF Package includes</p>
<ul>
<li>VNF Descriptor: containing all the information required by the NFVO for deploying the VNF (more information available at the <a href="../vnf-descriptor">VNF Descriptor page</a>).</li>
<li>Image: passed using a link to an image file (typically QCOW) available for being dowloaded via HTTP. At the moment, passing an image file inside the VNF Package is not supported: there is some work in progress to allow it.</li>
<li>Metadata file providing additional information to the NFVO for understanding what's the content of the package.</li>
<li>scripts: containing all the scripts which could be used for lifecycle management.</li>
</ul>
<p>A typical VNF Package has the following structure:</p>
<pre><code class="bash">- Metadata.yaml
- vnfd.json
- scripts/
    - 1_script.sh
    - 2_script.sh
</code></pre>

<h2 id="metadatayaml">Metadata.yaml</h2>
<p>The Metadata.yaml defines essential properties for the VNF. This file is based on the YAML syntax where information are stored in simple &lt;key> : &lt;value> associations.</p>
<p>The example of the Metadata file below shows a basic definition of a VNF Package.</p>
<pre><code class="yaml">name: VNF_package_name
scripts-link: scripts_link
vim_types: list_of_vim_types
description: description_of_VNF
provider: provider_of_package
nfvo_version: target_NFVO_version
image:
    upload: option
    ids: list_of_ids
    names: list_of_names
    link: image_link
image-config:
    name: image_name
    diskFormat: disk_format
    containerFormat: container_format
    minCPU: min_cpu
    minDisk: min_disk
    minRam: min_ram
    isPublic: is_public
</code></pre>

<p>In the following each property is explained in more detail. Please consider also the notes since some properties are optional (or even not implemented) and if they are defined, they may have more priority than others and override them therefore.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>name</em></strong>: The name defines the name of the VNF Package itself used to store it in the database</li>
<li><strong><em>description</em></strong>: Human readable description of the VNF</li>
<li><strong><em>provider</em></strong>: The creator and maintainer of the VNF</li>
<li><strong><em>vim_types</em></strong>: The list of the vim types that the VNF Package supports. VIM types are related to the plugin types installed on the NFVO. More info can be found <a href="../vim-driver">here</a>.</li>
<li><strong><em>nfvo_version</em></strong>: The version of the NFVO which supports this package in the format (X.Y.Z). First two digits (X.Y) will be used for checking whether the VNF Package is supported by the NFVO on top of which is going to be on-boarded</li>
<li><strong><em>scripts-link</em></strong>: This link points to a public git repository where scripts are stored and could be used instead of passing all scripts inside the VNF Package<ul>
<li><strong>Note</strong> Either you can define the scripts-link or put the scripts into the folder scripts/.
    The scripts-link has a higher priority than the scripts located in the folder scripts/.
    So if you set the scripts-link, the scripts in folder scripts/ are completely ignored.</li>
<li><strong>Note</strong> In most of the cases using script-link means that any component should be able to fetch files from that link.
    So you need to take care about ensuring that the URL defined is publicly available.</li>
<li><strong>Note</strong> Scripts are executed during different lifecycle-events, and need to be referenced inside the VNF Descriptor</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong><em>image</em></strong>:<ul>
<li><strong><em>upload</em></strong>: Here you can choose between different options (true, false, check).<ul>
<li>true: choosing this option means to upload the defined image on all the VimInstances. It does not matter if an image with the defined name exists or not.</li>
<li>false: choosing this option means that you assume that the image is already present on the VimInstaces and should be re-uploaded.
If the image does not exist, the VNF Package onboarding will throw an exception.
In this case the image (if defined) will be ignored.</li>
<li>check: this option means that the VNF PackageManagement checks first if the image is available (defined in ids or names).
If the image does not exist, a new one with the image defined in the VNF Package will be created.</li>
<li><strong>Note</strong> Please use quotation marks for this option since the values are handled as strings internally.
Otherwise true and false will be handled as a boolean that would lead to a faulty behavior when onboarding a new VNF Package.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong><em>ids</em></strong>: The list of image IDs is used to fetch the image from the corresponding VimInstance.
    To do it, the specific VIM driver iterates over all IDs and checks if an image with that ID exists on the VimInstance.
    The defined IDs have a higher priority than the list of names.
    We distinguish between the following cases:<ul>
<li>If it finds no image with these IDs, it continues with the list of image names.</li>
<li>If it finds one image with these IDs, this image will be used.</li>
<li>If it finds multiple images with the same ID (should never happen) or multiple IDs matching to multiple images, an exception will be thrown because it is not clear which image to use.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong><em>names</em></strong>: The list of image names is used to fetch the image from the corresponding VimInstance.
    To do it, manager iterates over all names and checks if an image with that name exists on the VimInstance.
    The list of names have a lower priority than the list of IDs.
    We distinguish between the following cases:<ul>
<li>If it finds no image with that name, an exception will be thrown except you defined the upload option check.
Then it will create a new image defined in the VNF Package.</li>
<li>If it finds one image, this image will be used.</li>
<li>If it finds multiple images with the same name or multiple names matching to multiple images, an exception will be thrown because it is not clear which image to use.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong><em>link</em></strong>: This link points to a URL providing the image file available for being uploaded on the VIM.<ul>
<li><strong>Note</strong> If you want to upload a new Image to the VIM you need to specify <code>true</code> or <code>check</code> in the <code>upload</code> option.
    Otherwise a NotFoundException will be thrown and the VNF Package will not be onboarded.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong><em>image-config</em></strong>: All the properties explained below are required to upload the image to the VIM properly.
    In case of creating a new image this configuration will be used and is obviously mandatory.<ul>
<li><strong><em>name</em></strong>: This defines the name for the image to upload either located directly in the VNF Package or available via the URL defined in image-link.</li>
<li><strong><em>diskFormat</em></strong>: The diskFormat defines the format in which disk type the image is stored.</li>
<li><strong><em>containerFormat</em></strong>: The containerFormat defines the format in which container type the image is stored .</li>
<li><strong><em>minCPU</em></strong>: The minCPU defines the minimum amount of CPU cores for using this image properly.</li>
<li><strong><em>minDisk</em></strong>: The minDisk defines the minimum amount of disk space for using this image properly.</li>
<li><strong><em>minRam</em></strong>: The minRam defines the minimum amount of RAM for using this image properly.</li>
<li><strong><em>isPublic</em></strong>: The isPublic defines whether the image will be available publicly to all tenants on VIM or not.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="vnfd62json">&lt;VNFD>.json</h2>
<p>The &lt;vnfd>.json contains the VirtualNetworkFunctionDescriptor (VNFD) onboarded to the Orchestrator.
This VNFD can later be referenced in a NSD by its ID to make use of it.
A more detailed explanation of the VNFD can be found <a href="../vnf-descriptor">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> You can specify any names for the file, but its extension must be <code>.json</code>.</p>
<h2 id="scripts">scripts</h2>
<p>The scripts folder contains all the scripts required for instatiating, configuring, and starting a VNF on the Virtual Machines or containers instantiated during the lifecycle.
The execution order is defined by the lifecycle_events inside the VNFD. Please refer to the <a href="../vnf-descriptor">VNF Description page</a> for more information about this.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> The scripts in the folder <strong><em>scripts</em></strong> are fetched only if the <strong><em>scripts-link</em></strong> is not defined in the <strong><em>Metadata.yaml</em></strong>.
    This means that the scripts in that folder have less priority than the scripts located under <strong><em>scripts-link</em></strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> Scripts are executed when a specific lifecycle event is fired and this event references to specific scripts.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> At the moment the <em>scripts</em> folder cannot contain subfolder. All scripts must be under the <em>scripts</em> folder.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> The scripts inside the <em>scripts</em> folder can be either shell scripts or python scripts. Runtime parameters could be passed to those scritps in different ways, depending on the VNF Manager used for managing your VNFs. We suggest you get familiar with the requirements of the VNF Manager you would like to use, before starting implementing any scripts for lifecycle management.  </p>
<h1 id="sample-tutorial">Sample tutorial</h1>
<p>This section provides an example about how to create, upload and make use of VNF Packages.
The chosen scenario is a simple network service using <a href="https://iperf.fr/">iPerf</a> in a server/client scenario. 
iPerf is a tool for active measurements of the maximum achievable bandwidth on IP networks. 
This tutorial is similar to the one already described in the <a href="../iperf-NSR/">iperf tutorial</a>, however making use of VNF packages instead of just the network service descriptor. </p>
<h2 id="creation-of-vnf-packages">Creation of VNF Packages</h2>
<p>For doing so, we need to create two VNF Packages and reference them in the NSD.
So we need a VNF Package for the iperf server (called iperf-server) and for the iperf client (called iperf-client).
First we will start with the creation of the iperf-server VNF Package and then we will create the iperf-client VNF Package.</p>
<p>First of all we should create a directory for each VNF Package where we put all the files related to the VNF Package because in the end we need to pack them into a tar archive for onboarding it on the NFVO.</p>
<h3 id="vnf-package-iperf-server">VNF Package [iperf-server]</h3>
<p>This iperf-server VNF Package has to install the iperf server and needs to provide its ip to the iperf client.</p>
<h4 id="metadata-iperf-server">Metadata [iperf-server]</h4>
<p>In the Metadata.yaml we define the name of the VNF Package, the scripts location and also the properties for the image to use or upload.
Since passing an image is not supported in the current release we will use the image link inside the <code>Metadata.yaml</code>.
Finally, it looks as shown below.</p>

          files that are downloaded to your computer, to improve your experience. This page describes what

      </div>
      <div class="modal-body">
        <p>
          The Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft zur Förderung der angewandten Forschung e.V. (Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft)
          takes the protection of your personal data very seriously. When we process the personal data that is
          collected during your visits to our Web site, we always observe the rules laid down in the
          applicable data protection laws. Your data will not be disclosed publicly by us, nor transferred to
          any third parties without your consent.
          <br>
          <br>

          <b>1. Recording and processing of data in connection with access over the Internet</b><br>
          When you visit our Web site, our Web server makes a temporary record of each access and stores it in
          a log file. The following data are recorded, and stored until an automatic deletion date:
        <ul>
          <li>IP address of the requesting processor</li>
          <li>Date and time of access</li>
          <li>Name and URL of the downloaded file</li>
          <li>Volume of data transmitted</li>
          <li>Indication whether download was successful</li>
          <li>Data identifying the browser software and operating system</li>
          <li>Web site from which our site was accessed</li>
          <li>Name of your Internet service provider</li>
        </ul>
        The purpose of recording these data is to allow use of the Web site (connection setup), for system
        security, for technical administration of the network infrastructure and in order to op-timize our
        Internet service. The IP address is only evaluated in the event of fraudulent access to the network
        infrastructure of the Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft.
        <br>
        Apart from the special cases cited above, we do not process personal data without first obtaining your
        explicit consent to do so. Pseudonymous user profiles can be created as stated under web analysis (see
        below).

        <br>
        <br>
        <b>​2. Orders</b><br>
        If you order information material or other goods via our website, we will use the address data provided
        only for the purpose of processing your order.

        <br>
        <br>
        <b>3. Use and transfer of personal data</b><br>
        All use of your personal data is confined to the purposes stated above, and is only under-taken to the
        extent necessary for these purposes. Your data is not disclosed to third parties.
        <br>
        Personal data will not be transferred to government bodies or public authorities except in order to
        comply with mandatory national legislation or if the transfer of such data should be necessary in order
        to take legal action in cases of fraudulent access to our network infrastructure. Personal data will not
        be transferred for any other purpose.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>4. Consent to use data in other contexts</b><br>

        The use of certain services on our website, such as newsletters or discussion forums, may re-quire prior
        registration and involves a more substantial processing of personal data, such as longer-term storage of
        e-mail addresses, user IDs and passwords. We use such data only insofar as it has been sent to us by you
        in person and you have given us your express prior consent for this use. For example, we request your
        consent separately in the following cases:
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>4.1 Newsletters and press distribution</b><br>

        In order to register for a newsletter service provided by the Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft, we need at least
        your e-mail address so that we know where to send the newsletter. All other information you supply is on
        a voluntary basis, and will be only if you give your consent, for example to contact you directly or
        clear up questions concerning your e-mail address. If you request delivery by post, we need your postal
        address. If you ask to be included on a press distribution list, we need to know which publication you
        work for, to allow us to check whether specific publications are actually receiving our press material.
        <br>
        As a general rule, we employ the double opt-in method for the registration. In other words, after you
        have registered for the service and informed us of your e-mail address, you will receive an e-mail in
        return from us, containing a link that you must use to con-firm your registration. Your registration and
        confirmation will be recorded. The newsletter will not be sent until this has been done. This procedure
        is used to ensure that only you yourself can register with the newsletter service under the specified
        e-mail address. You must confirm your registration as soon as possible after receiving our e-mail,
        otherwise your registration and e-mail address will be erased from our database. Until we receive your
        confirmation, our newsletter service will refuse to accept any other registration re-quests using this
        e-mail address.
        <br>
        You can cancel subscriptions to our newsletters at any time. To do so, either send us an e-mail or
        follow the link at the end of the newsletter.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>​4.2 Visitors’ books and forums</b><br>
        If you wish to sign up for an Internet forum run by the Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft, we need at least a user
        ID, a password, and your e-mail address. For your own protection, the reg-istration procedure for this
        type of service, like that for the newsletters, involves you con-firming your request using the link
        contained in the e-mail we send you and you giving your consent to the use of further personal data
        where this is necessary to use the forum.
        <br>
        You can cancel your registration for this type of service at any time, by sending us an e-mail via the
        Web page offering the service.
        <br>
        As a general rule, the content of visitors’ books and forums is not subject to any form of monitoring by
        the Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft. Nevertheless, we reserve the right to delete posted contributions and to
        prohibit users from further use of the service at our own dis-cretion, especially in cases where posted
        content contravenes the law or is deemed in-compatible with the objectives of the
        Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft.
        <br>
        <br>

        <b>5. Cookies</b><br>
        We don’t normally use cookies on our Web site, but in certain exceptional cases we may use cookies which
        place technical session-control data in your browser’s memory. These data are automatically erased at
        the latest when you close your browser.
        <br>
        If, exceptionally, one of our applications requires the storage of personal data in a cookie, for
        instance a user ID, we will point out you to it.
        <br>
        Of course, it is perfectly possible to consult our Web site without the use of cookies. Please note,
        however, that most browsers are programmed to accept cookies in their de-fault configuration. You can
        prevent this by changing the appropriate setting in the browser options. If you set the browser to
        refuse all cookies, this may restrict your use of certain functions on our Website
        <br>
        <br>

        <b>6. Web analysis</b><br>
        Personal user profiles are not created. However, Section 15 (3) of the Telemedia Act (TMG) permits the
        use of user profiles under a pseudonym for the purpose of advertising, market research and the
        structuring of offers in line with the user's needs provided that the user does not object to this:
        <br>
        We also use web analysis services on our web pages, for example from etracker or WiredMinds, which carry
        out the web analysis on our behalf as contract processors (see the websites of www.wiredminds.de for
        these providers). Their services have been checked by the supervisory authorities and/or experts and
        meet all requirements under German and European data protection laws.
        <br>
        Using the technologies of these providers, data is collected and stored on our website. From this data,
        user profiles are produced under a pseudonym for marketing and optimi-zation purposes, for which cookies
        may be used. Cookies are small text files that are stored locally in the cache memory of the site
        visitor's web browser. The cookies enable the web browser to be recognized. Furthermore, your user
        behavior can be measured via a JavaScript code and data collected in this connection can be sent
        directly to the provider's servers in Germany or the EU via an HTML connection. Without your express
        consent, the data collected using the tracking technologies will not be used to personally identify you
        and will not be combined with the personal data about the bearer of the pseudonym. No cross-website
        analysis will be carried out either.
        <br>
        <br> If you wish to technically stop the tracking, you can deactivate JavaScript and cookies in your web
        browser. Consent for the collection and storage of data can also be refused with effect for the future
        at any time. Please follow this link to refuse the service provided by WiredMinds:
        <a href="http://wm.wiredminds.de">http://wm.wiredminds.de.</a>
        <br>
        <br>

        <b>7. Social plugins</b><br>
        We also use social plugins in some cases on our webpages, e.g. from the Facebook, Twit-ter, YouTube or
        Google+ social networks. These are often technically operated in the USA or in other countries outside
        Germany and the EU and some are offered via national companies in the EU (see the websites
        www.facebook.de, www.twitter.de, www.youtube.de or www.google.de for the providers). The plugins are
        identified with the companies’ logo, comment fields or what are known as a “Like” or “+1” button.
        <br>
        If you open a page of our website in your web browser containing such a plugin, your web browser will
        create a direct connection to the servers of the respective provider in the country concerned.
        <br>
        By incorporating the plugins the provider is given at the least the information that you have visited a
        certain page on our website, and perhaps also other information that your web browser or the device you
        use also discloses. The content of the plugin is loaded by your web browser directly from the provider
        and incorporated into our website. If you are registered and have logged in with the provider concerned,
        your visit can also be assigned to your user account.
        <br>
        If you interact with a plugin, e.g. if you click on the “Like” button or enter a comment in a form
        field, your browser will also transmit this information directly to the provider where it will be saved
        and, if applicable, continue to be used and published.
        <br>
        Above all, marketing measures of the provider and the Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft are the reason for the
        collection and use of the data as described and determine the extent of this. You can find details on
        this and on your rights and on ways in which you can pre-vent the collection and use of your data in
        order to protect your private sphere directly in the data privacy policy of the respective provider.
        <br>
        If you do not wish a provider to collect data on you through our website you must deacti-vate the
        plugins in your web browser. If you wish to avoid a link to any existing user account, you must log out
        before your visit to our website. By visiting our website, you de-clare your consent to the above
        provisions.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>8. Security </b><br>
        The Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft implements technical and organizational security measures to safeguard
        stored personal data against inadvertent or deliberate manipulation, loss or destruction and against
        access by unauthorized persons. Our security measures are continuously im-proved in line with
        technological progress.
        <br><br>
        <b>9. Links to Web sites operated by other providers</b><br>
        Our Web pages may contain links to other providers’ Web pages. We would like to point out that this
        statement of data protection conditions applies exclusively to the Web pages managed by the
        Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft. We have no way of influencing the practices of other providers with respect to
        data protection, nor do we carry out any checks to ensure that they conform with the relevant
        legislation.
        <br><br>
        <b>10. Right to information and contact data</b><br>
        You have a legal right to inspect any stored data concerning your person, and also the right to demand
        their correction or deletion, and to withdraw your consent for their further use.
        <br>
        In some cases, if you are a registered user of certain services provided by the Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft,
        we offer you the possibility of inspecting these data online, and even of deleting or modifying the data
        yourself, via a user account.
        <br>
        If you wish to obtain information on your personal data, or want us to correct or erase such data, or if
        you have any other questions concerning the use of personal data held by us, please contact: <a
              href="mailto:data-protection@zv.fraunhofer.de">data-protection@zv.fraunhofer.de</a>
        <br><br>
        <b>11. Acceptance, validity and modification of data protection conditions</b><br>
        By using our Web site, you implicitly agree to accept the use of your personal data as specified above.
        This present statement of data protection conditions came into effect on October 1st, 2013. As our Web
        site evolves, and new technologies come into use, it may become necessary to amend the statement of data
        protection conditions. The Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft reserves the right to modify its data protection
        conditions at any time, with effect as of a future date. We recommend that you reread the latest version
        from time to time.
