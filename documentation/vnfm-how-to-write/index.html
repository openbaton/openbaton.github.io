                          <h1 id="how-to-write-a-vnf-manager">How to write a VNF Manager</h1>
<p>This section is going to describe how to write your own VNF Manager by using the vnfm-sdk.
Moreover, the vnfm-sdk contains all the things you may need for the development of the VNFManager of your choice as well.</p>
<p>The vnfm-sdk provides the following things:</p>
<ul>
<li>multiple <a href="#choose-a-vnfm-sdk">vnfm-sdks</a> where you can choose your preferred type of communication</li>
<li>Catalogue, shared with the NFVO containing all entities</li>
<li><a href="#using-the-vnfmhelper">VNFMHelper</a> for providing some methods out of the box</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>
<p>Before you can start with developing your own VNFManager you need to prepare your programming environment by installing/configuring the following requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>JDK 8 (<a href="http://openjdk.java.net/install/">installation</a>)</li>
<li>Gradle 1.12 or above (<a href="https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/installation.html">installation</a>)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="develop-your-own-vnfmanager">Develop your own VNFManager</h2>
<p>This part is going to describe the steps you need to do to develop your own VNFManager with the help of any vnfm-sdk.</p>
<p>The practical parts of implementing a basic VNFManager will focus on the usage of a specific vnfm-sdk, namely the vnfm-sdk-amqp.</p>
<h3 id="preparations">Preparations</h3>
<p>This section describes the initial steps for creating the project structure and configuring essential files for developing your own VNFManager.
This can be done in two ways.
Either you may use your favorite IDE or you may do everything manually via the command line.</p>
<p>Once this is done, you can start implementing your VNFManager by using different communication models, the catalogue and several helpers.</p>
<h4 id="using-your-favorite-ide">Using your favorite IDE</h4>
<p>In the following we will create the project and setup the configuration files by using your favorite IDE.
So first of all, start your IDE and go to the next step.
All the details base on the usage of <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/?fromMenu">IntelliJIdea</a>.</p>
<h5 id="create-a-new-project">Create a new project</h5>
<p>Once you have started the IDE, click on File -&gt; New -&gt; Project...</p>
<p>In this dialog click on Gradle on the left and select java in the main properties window in the middle.</p>
<p><img alt="dialog" src="../images/vnfm-how-to-write-intellijidea-new_project-type.png" /></p>
<p>Then click on next to go to the next window.</p>
<p>In the next dialog you need to define the GroupId, ArtifactId and the Version.
More information on the specific meaning can be found <a href="https://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-naming-conventions.html">here</a>.</p>
<p><img alt="dialog" src="../images/vnfm-how-to-write-intellijidea-new-project-group.png" /></p>
<p>Continue with the next dialog.</p>
<p>In this dialog you need to specify which gradle you want to use.
It is recommend to use the default gradle wrapper.
Additionally you can enable the auto-import.</p>
<p><img alt="dialog" src="../images/vnfm-how-to-write-intellijidea-new-project-gradle.png" /></p>
<p>Continue with the next dialog by clicking on Next.</p>
<p>In the last dialog, you need to define the project name and the project location.</p>
<p><img alt="dialog" src="../images/vnfm-how-to-write-intellijidea-new-project-name.png" /></p>
<p>Once this is done you can click on Finish and continue with creating the Main Class.</p>
<h5 id="create-the-main-class">Create the Main Class</h5>
<p>Afterwards, you need to create the Main Class of the VNFManager which will be started in the end.
For doing so, right click on the root folder my-vnfm, then click on New -&gt; Directory and insert what is show below.</p>
<p><img alt="dialog" src="../images/vnfm-how-to-write-intellijidea-new-directory.png" /></p>
<p>Click on OK to continue.</p>
<p>Additionally you need to create a new package.
This is done by a right-click on the previously created directory java.
Click on New -&gt; Package.
Here you can define the package name.</p>
<p><img alt="dialog" src="../images/vnfm-how-to-write-intellijidea-new-package.png" /></p>
<p>Finally you can create your Main Class by clicking (right click) on the previously created package and click on New -&gt; Java Class.</p>
<p><img alt="dialog" src="../images/vnfm-how-to-write-intellijidea-new-class.png" /></p>
<p>Once you did all these steps, the initial project structure is created.
What we miss right now is the configuration of the gradle files to define and fetch dependencies we need for implementing the VNFManager.
This is described in later sections.</p>
<h5 id="create-the-properties-files">Create the properties files</h5>
<p>The properties files are used to define several parameters you need at runtime.
So just create the following file structure.</p>
<p>Do a right-click on the main folder located in the src folder.
Click on New -&gt; Directory and create a new folder with the name resources.</p>
<p>Do again a right-click on the newly created folder resources and click on New -&gt; File.
This you need to do two times.
The first file is called application.properties and the second one is called conf.properties.</p>
<p>What these files should contain is explained <a href="#property-files">here</a>.</p>
<h4 id="using-the-command-line">Using the command line</h4>
<p>This section refers to the developers which don't like to use any IDE.
By not using any IDE we need to create all the folders and configuration files manually.
So we start with creating the project structure, the Main Class, initializing the gradle wrapper and according configuration files.</p>
<h5 id="create-project-folder">Create project folder</h5>
<p>First of all you need to create a new directory for your VNFManager.
Here we call the new VNFManager my-vnfm.
So this can be replaced by whatever you want.</p>
<pre><code class="bash">$ mkdir my-vnfm
</code></pre>

<h5 id="create-the-main-class_1">Create the Main Class</h5>
<p>The Main class is the most important class you need to consider.
Here you implement your main method and also methods you need to have for your VNFManager.
Further explanations are done in the according sections.
This is only for creating a proper file structure.
So execute the following commands to create the Main class in a proper folder and package structure.</p>
<p>First, you need to create the folders and package by executing the following command in your root folder of the project.</p>
<pre><code class="bash">$ mkdir -p src/main/java/org/openbaton/vnfm
</code></pre>

<p>This creates the java folder src/main/java with the proposed package name org.openbaton.vnfm.</p>
<p>In the next step you create the Main Class called MyVNFM in this case.</p>
<pre><code class="bash">$ vim src/main/java/org/openbaton/vnfm/MyVNFM.java
</code></pre>

<p>At this point you create only the basic Java Class used later as the Main Class for implementing your VNFManager.
The newly created Java Class should contain the following lines for now.</p>
<pre><code class="java">package org.openbaton.vnfm;

public class MyVNFM {
}
</code></pre>

<p>If you have chosen a different package name you need to replace it as well at this point.
Once this is done, you need to initialize the gradle wrapper and configuring according files.</p>
<h5 id="the-buildgradle-file">The Build.Gradle file</h5>
<p>First you need to create the build.gradle file by executing the following command from your root project folder.</p>
<pre><code class="bash">$ vim build.gradle
</code></pre>

<p>This gradle configuration file needs to contain initially the following lines.</p>
<pre><code class="gradle">buildscript {
    repositories {
        mavenCentral()
    }

    dependencies {
        classpath(&quot;org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-gradle-plugin:1.3.1.RELEASE&quot;)
    }
}

apply plugin: 'java'
apply plugin: 'spring-boot'
</code></pre>

<p>The second gradle configuration is called settings.gradle.
This file contains only the project name.
So create a new file called settings.gradle in your root folder.</p>
<pre><code class="bash">$ vim settings.gradle
</code></pre>

<p>Afterwards you need to add the following line containing your project name.
In our case my-vnfm.</p>
<pre><code class="gradle">rootProject.name = 'my-vnfm'
</code></pre>

<p>Afterwards go back to the root folder and run the following command to create automatically the gradle wrapper which is used for code management and compilation.
For more information on how to use the gradle wrapper have a look at the gradle wrapper documentation <a href="https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html">here</a>.</p>
<pre><code class="bash">$ gradle wrapper
</code></pre>

<p>Once you did all these steps, the initial project structure is created.
What we miss right now is the configuration of the gradle files to define and fetch dependencies we need for implementing the VNFManager.
This is described in later sections.</p>
<h5 id="create-the-properties-files_1">Create the properties files</h5>
<p>The properties files are used to define several parameters you need at runtime.
So just create the following file structure by executing the following commands.</p>
<pre><code class="bash">$ mkdir src/main/resources
</code></pre>

<p>Now you need to create two new files by running both commands you can find in the following</p>
<pre><code class="bash">$ touch src/main/resources/application.properties
$ touch src/main/resources/conf.properties
</code></pre>

<p>What these files should contain is explained <a href="#property-files">here</a>.</p>
<h4 id="configure-gradle">Configure Gradle</h4>
<p>Finally you need to extend your build.gradle for announcing the Main Class, plugins to apply and repositories to use.
So open the build.gradle an add missing line so that the file contains the following line.</p>
<pre><code class="gradle">//...

bootRepackage {
    mainClass = 'org.openbaton.vnfm.MyVNFM'
}

//...
</code></pre>

<p>Take care about the configuration of the mainClass.
If the name or package of your mainClass is different, you need to replace it here as well.</p>
<h4 id="property-files">Property files</h4>
<p>The previously created properties files are used to define several things.
They are located in src/main/resources and are called application.properties and conf.properties.</p>
<p>The <strong>application.properties</strong> contains parameters for setting up all log levels. This file is useful for configuring the springframework (see <a href="http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/common-application-properties.html">Spring Boot configuration file</a>). This file can contain the following lines.</p>
<pre><code class="properties">
vnfm.type=my-vnfm
vnfm.endpoint=my-vnfm-endpoint
vnfm.endpoint.type = RABBIT

</code></pre>

<p>If you want to change log levels you need to adapt it here.</p>
<p><em><strong>NOTE</strong></em>: <em>If your VNFManager is running on a different machine than the rabbitmq broker, you need to change the <code>vnfm.rabbit.brokerIp</code> accordingly with the ip of the rabbitmq broker.</em></p>
<p>The <strong>conf.properties</strong> is also a very important configuration file.
Here you need to define the type and endpoint of your VNFManager that is later used for registering on the NFVO.
Furthermore, you can define your own parameters which can be used at runtime for whatever you want.
So this file has to contain at least the type and endpoint.
Additionally, it is defined the folder where the vim drivers are located.
In this case the file should contain the following lines.</p>
<pre><code class="gradle">allocate = false
description=The VNFM able to handle all the VNFs that follow specific conventions, see http://openbaton.github.io/
enabled = true
endpoint-type = RABBIT
script-max-time = 300000
concurrency = 15


#### Additionally
vim-plugin-dir = ./plugins

<h2 id="choose-a-vnfm-sdk">Choose a vnfm-sdk</h2>
<p>Before you can start with the implementation you need to select the type of communication you want to use for the communication between the Orchestrator (NFVO) and the VNFManager.
Either you can use the vnfm-sdk-amqp for using the <a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/">RabbitMQ</a> or the vnfm-sdk-rest for using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer">ReST</a> interface.
However, your choice doesn't effect the upcoming implementation, because the communication itself is done automatically in the background.
But have in mind that both libraries depend on <a href="http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/">SpringBoot</a>.
So, if you want to avoid this dependency, a third option might be: just use the simple vnfm-sdk artifact.
By using the simple vnfm-sdk you need to take care about all the communication between NFVO and VNFManager by yourself.</p>
<p>Once you have imported one of the vnfm-sdks you will have access to all the model classes and the vnfm-sdk classes needed to implement a VNFManager.</p>
<p>The following section shows you how to import the vnfm-sdk-amqp, representative for all the other opportunities.</p>
<h3 id="import-a-vnfm-sdk">Import a vnfm-sdk</h3>
<p>This section shows how to import and configure your VNFManager to make use of the vnfm-sdk-amqp.</p>
<p>For gathering the vnfm-sdk-amqp library you need to import the libraries by adding the missing lines to your build.gradle:</p>
<pre><code class="gradle">//...

dependencies {
    compile 'org.hibernate:hibernate-core:4.3.10.Final'
    compile 'org.openbaton:vnfm-sdk-amqp:5.2.0'
}

//...
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Note</strong> To make use of the vnfm-sdk-rest you need to change 'vnfm-sdk-amqp' to 'vnfm-sdk-rest' only.</p>
<p>So the final build.gradle file results like:</p>
<pre><code class="gradle">buildscript {
    repositories {
        mavenCentral()
    }
    dependencies {
        classpath(&quot;org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-gradle-plugin:1.3.1.RELEASE&quot;)
    }

}

apply plugin: 'java'
apply plugin: 'spring-boot'

repositories {
    mavenCentral()
    /**
     * Only needed for openbaton snapshots dependencies
     */
    maven {
        url 'https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/'
    }
}

dependencies {
    compile 'org.openbaton:vnfm-sdk-amqp:5.2.0'
    compile 'org.hibernate:hibernate-core:4.3.10.Final'
}

group 'your.group'
version '1.0-SNAPSHOT'

bootRepackage {
    mainClass = 'org.openbaton.vnfm.MyVNFM'
}
</code></pre>

<p>Once you did this, you need to trigger the gradle build process by running the following command via the command line in your project's root folder.</p>
<pre><code class="bash">$ ./gradlew build
</code></pre>

<p>This will fetch all the dependencies defined in the build.gradle and gives you access to all the Classes you need.
You can also do this by using the IDE by running the corresponding gradle task.</p>
<h2 id="implementation-of-the-vnfmanager">Implementation of the VNFManager</h2>
<p>This section is going to describe the implementation of a basic VNFManager by using the vnfm-sdk-amqp.
In the end, the VNFManager will be able to allocate and terminate resources by using its own openstack-plugin.</p>
<p>So first of all you need to define the main method used for starting your VNFManager.
So add the following to your Main Class that it looks as follows:</p>
<pre><code class="java">package org.openbaton.vnfm;

import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;

public class MyVNFM {

    public static void main(String[] args){
        SpringApplication.run(MyVNFM.class);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Afterwards you need to extend your Main Class (in this case MyVNFM) with the <em>AbstractVnfmSpringAmqp</em>.</p>
<p>The <em>AbstractVnfmSpringAmqp</em> takes care of all the configuration you need to register/unregister the VNFManager to the NFVO and handles incoming messages.
Whereas the <em>AbstractVnfm</em>, extended by the <em>AbstractVnfmSpringAmqp</em>, is independent of the type of communication.
This means more in detail that the <em>AbstractVnfm</em> processes the incoming messages and executes the right method depending on the defined Action inside the message.
Moreover, it is responsible for loading predefined configuration files, setting up the VNFManager itself, creating the VNFR (based on the VNFD received in the first step) and doing essential parts like requesting the NFVO for granting operations or deciding who is responsible for allocate resources.</p>
<p>Once you extended your VNFMManger, you need to implement all the methods coming from the extension of <em>AbstractVnfmSpringAmqp</em> as shown below:</p>
<pre><code class="java">package org.openbaton.vnfm;

import org.openbaton.catalogue.mano.record.VNFCInstance;
import org.openbaton.catalogue.mano.record.VNFRecordDependency;
import org.openbaton.catalogue.mano.record.VirtualNetworkFunctionRecord;
import org.openbaton.catalogue.nfvo.Action;
import org.openbaton.catalogue.nfvo.VimInstance;
import org.openbaton.common.vnfm_sdk.amqp.AbstractVnfmSpringAmqp;
import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;

import java.util.Collection;
import java.util.Map;

@SpringBootApplication
public class MyVNFM extends AbstractVnfmSpringAmqp{

    public static void main(String[] args){
        SpringApplication.run(MyVNFM.class);
    }

    /**
     * This operation allows creating a VNF instance.
     *
     * @param virtualNetworkFunctionRecord
     * @param scripts
     * @param vimInstances
     */
    @Override
    public VirtualNetworkFunctionRecord instantiate(VirtualNetworkFunctionRecord virtualNetworkFunctionRecord, Object scripts, Map&lt;String, Collection&lt;VimInstance&gt;&gt; vimInstances) throws Exception {
        return virtualNetworkFunctionRecord;
    }

    /**
     * This operation allows retrieving
     * VNF instance state and attributes.
     */
    @Override
    public void query() {

    }

    /**
     * This operation allows scaling
     * (out/in, up/down) a VNF instance.
     */
    @Override
    public VirtualNetworkFunctionRecord scale(Action scaleInOrOut, VirtualNetworkFunctionRecord virtualNetworkFunctionRecord, VNFComponent component, Object scripts, VNFRecordDependency dependency) throws Exception {
        return virtualNetworkFunctionRecord;
    }


    /**
     * This operation allows verifying if

</code></pre>

<p>Now you can implement whatever you want. If the VirtualNetworkFunctionRecord is returned, it will go back directly to the NFVO.</p>
<p>One of the methods that can be overwritten is the <em>fillParameters</em>. This method is important when you have specified some "provides" in your VNFD, in fact you can fill them in this method and make them available afterwards to the scripts (see <a href="../vnf-parameters">How to use the parameters</a>).</p>
<p>An example of allocating and terminating resource by using a plugin can be found <a href="#allocate-resources">here</a> and <a href="#release-resources">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> If you use vnfm-sdk-amqp or vnfm-sdk-rest <strong><em>the VNFManager main class needs to be stateless</em></strong> since it can (will) run each method potentially in parallel.
For what concerns vnfm-sdk-amqp, even setting concurrency to 1, will not ensure to have always the same instance of the class.</p>
<h4 id="using-the-vnfmhelper">Using the VnfmHelper</h4>
<p>Additionally you can autowire the VnfmHelper to make use of several helper methods that are very useful.
In this case your VNFManager should look like this:</p>
<pre><code class="java">package org.openbaton.vnfm;

import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;

public class MyVNFM extends AbstractVnfmSpringAmqp {

    @Autowired
    private VnfmHelper vnfmHelper;

    [...]
}
</code></pre>

<p>The vnfmHelper helps with some methods out of the box:</p>
<pre><code class="java">package org.openbaton.common.vnfm_sdk;

import org.openbaton.catalogue.nfvo.messages.Interfaces.NFVMessage;

public abstract class VnfmHelper {

    /**
     * This operation sends a NFVMessage
     * to the NFVO and doesn't wait for answer.
     * @param nfvMessage
     */
    public abstract void sendToNfvo(NFVMessage nfvMessage);

    /**
     * This operation send a NFVMessage
     * to the NFVO and waits for the answer.
     * @param nfvMessage
     */
    public abstract NFVMessage sendAndReceive(NFVMessage nfvMessage) throws Exception;
}
</code></pre>

<p>At the moment, the main purpose of the VnfmHelper is to send messages to the NFVO and wait for the answer if needed.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> This class needs to be implemented in case you want to use only the vnfm-sdk and must be provided to the AbstractVnfm.</p>
<h4 id="using-plugins">Using plugins</h4>
<p>This section describes the initialization and usage of plugins.
Therefore, you need to do several things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Start the plugins</li>
<li>Connect an according VIM to the plugin or use the plugin directly</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note</strong> If you want to use the Vim with plugins, you need to fetch also the interfaces and VIM implementations by adding the following lines to your build.gradle dependencies</p>
<pre><code class="gradle">compile 'org.openbaton:vim-int:5.2.0'
compile 'org.openbaton:vim-impl:5.2.0'
compile 'org.openbaton:sdk:5.2.0'
</code></pre>

<p>After that you need to rebuild your project for fetching the dependencies automatically.</p>
<p>Now you can use the ResourceManagement interface.
In the end it should look like the following:</p>
<pre><code class="java">package org.openbaton.vnfm;

import org.openbaton.catalogue.mano.record.VNFCInstance;
import org.openbaton.catalogue.mano.record.VNFRecordDependency;
import org.openbaton.catalogue.mano.record.VirtualNetworkFunctionRecord;
import org.openbaton.catalogue.nfvo.Action;
import org.openbaton.catalogue.nfvo.VimInstance;
import org.openbaton.common.vnfm_sdk.amqp.AbstractVnfmSpringAmqp;
import org.openbaton.nfvo.vim_interfaces.resource_management.ResourceManagement;
import org.openbaton.plugin.utils.PluginStartup;
import org.openbaton.plugin.utils.RabbitPluginBroker;
import org.openbaton.vim.drivers.VimDriverCaller;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;
import org.springframework.context.ConfigurableApplicationContext;

import java.io.IOException;
import java.util.Collection;
import java.util.Map;

public class MyVNFM extends AbstractVnfmSpringAmqp {

    @Autowired
    private ConfigurableApplicationContext context;

    private ResourceManagement resourceManagement;

    private VimDriverCaller client;

    [...]

    @Override
    protected void setup() {
        super.setup();
        try {
            //Start all the plugins that are located in ./plugins
            PluginStartup.startPluginRecursive(&quot;./plugins&quot;, true, &quot;localhost&quot;, &quot;5672&quot;, 15, &quot;admin&quot;, &quot;openbaton&quot;, &quot;15672&quot;);
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
        //Fetching the OpenstackVim using the openstack-plugin
        resourceManagement = (ResourceManagement) context.getBean(&quot;openstackVIM&quot;, 19345, &quot;15672&quot;);
        //Using the openstack-plugin directly
        client = (VimDriverCaller) ((RabbitPluginBroker) context.getBean(&quot;rabbitPluginBroker&quot;)).getVimDriverCaller(&quot;localhost&quot;, &quot;admin&quot;, &quot;openbaton&quot;, 5672, &quot;openstack&quot;, &quot;openstack&quot;, &quot;15672&quot;);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This code expects that the plugins are located in ./plugins.
So just copy the openstack plugin of your choice to this path.
Now you are able to use a VIM inside or the directly the plugin in your VNFManager to allocate and release resources whenever you want.</p>
<h5 id="allocate-resources">Allocate Resources</h5>
<p>The following code snippet shows how to instantiate (allocate) resources at VNFManager side with the help of the VIM.</p>
<pre><code class="java">/**

            userdata += &quot;echo $GROUP_NAME &gt; /home/ubuntu/group_name.txt\n&quot;;
        }
    }
    userdata += getUserData();

    log.debug(&quot;Processing allocation of Recources for vnfr: &quot; + virtualNetworkFunctionRecord);
    for (VirtualDeploymentUnit vdu : virtualNetworkFunctionRecord.getVdu()) {

                    floatingIps.put(connectionPoint.getVirtual_link_reference(), connectionPoint.getFloatingIp());
                }
            }
            try {

                log.debug(&quot;Created VNFCInstance with id: &quot; + vnfcInstance);
                vdu.getVnfc_instance().add(vnfcInstance);
            } catch (VimException e) {
                log.error(e.getMessage());
                if (log.isDebugEnabled())

    return virtualNetworkFunctionRecord;
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Note</strong> Keep in mind that you need to set <em>allocate</em> to false in conf.properties, if you want to allocate resources on the VNFManager side. Otherwise the NFVO will allocate resources as well.</p>
<h5 id="release-resources">Release Resources</h5>
<p>The next code snippet shows an implementation of the terminate method used for releasing resources at VNFManager side.</p>
<pre><code class="java">/**

<h3 id="start-the-vnfmanager">Start the VNFManager</h3>
<p>Once you finalized your VNFManager you can compile and start it with the following commands.</p>
<pre><code class="bash">$ ./gradlew clean build
$ java -jar build/libs/my-vnfm-{version}.jar
</code></pre>

<p>If everything is fine, your VNFManager will register to NFVO and is able now to receive requests and process them.</p>

          From time to time we test new features and make subtle changes to the way that the site is
          delivered. When we are still testing new features these cookies may be used to ensure that you

          In some cases we may provide you with custom content based on what you tell us about yourself either

          <br>
          We also use social media buttons and/or plugins on this site that allow you to connect with your
          social network in various ways. For these to work the following social media sites including;
          Facebook, YouTube, will set cookies through our site which may be used to enhance your profile on
          their site or contribute to the data they hold for various purposes outlined in their respective
          privacy policies.

          Hopefully that has clarified things for you and as was previously mentioned if there is something
          that you aren't sure whether you need or not it's usually safer to leave cookies enabled in case it
          does interact with one of the features you use on our site. However if you are still looking for

          The Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft zur Förderung der angewandten Forschung e.V. (Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft)
          takes the protection of your personal data very seriously. When we process the personal data that is
          collected during your visits to our Web site, we always observe the rules laid down in the
          applicable data protection laws. Your data will not be disclosed publicly by us, nor transferred to
          any third parties without your consent.
          <br>
          <br>

          <b>1. Recording and processing of data in connection with access over the Internet</b><br>
          When you visit our Web site, our Web server makes a temporary record of each access and stores it in
          a log file. The following data are recorded, and stored until an automatic deletion date:
        <ul>
          <li>IP address of the requesting processor</li>
          <li>Date and time of access</li>
          <li>Name and URL of the downloaded file</li>
          <li>Volume of data transmitted</li>
          <li>Indication whether download was successful</li>
          <li>Data identifying the browser software and operating system</li>
          <li>Web site from which our site was accessed</li>
          <li>Name of your Internet service provider</li>
        </ul>
        The purpose of recording these data is to allow use of the Web site (connection setup), for system
        security, for technical administration of the network infrastructure and in order to op-timize our
        Internet service. The IP address is only evaluated in the event of fraudulent access to the network
        infrastructure of the Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft.
        <br>
        Apart from the special cases cited above, we do not process personal data without first obtaining your
        explicit consent to do so. Pseudonymous user profiles can be created as stated under web analysis (see
        below).

        <br>
        <br>
        <b>​2. Orders</b><br>
        If you order information material or other goods via our website, we will use the address data provided
        only for the purpose of processing your order.

        <br>
        <br>
        <b>3. Use and transfer of personal data</b><br>
        All use of your personal data is confined to the purposes stated above, and is only under-taken to the
        extent necessary for these purposes. Your data is not disclosed to third parties.
        <br>
        Personal data will not be transferred to government bodies or public authorities except in order to
        comply with mandatory national legislation or if the transfer of such data should be necessary in order
        to take legal action in cases of fraudulent access to our network infrastructure. Personal data will not
        be transferred for any other purpose.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>4. Consent to use data in other contexts</b><br>

        The use of certain services on our website, such as newsletters or discussion forums, may re-quire prior
        registration and involves a more substantial processing of personal data, such as longer-term storage of
        e-mail addresses, user IDs and passwords. We use such data only insofar as it has been sent to us by you
        in person and you have given us your express prior consent for this use. For example, we request your
        consent separately in the following cases:
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>4.1 Newsletters and press distribution</b><br>

        In order to register for a newsletter service provided by the Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft, we need at least
        your e-mail address so that we know where to send the newsletter. All other information you supply is on
        a voluntary basis, and will be only if you give your consent, for example to contact you directly or
        clear up questions concerning your e-mail address. If you request delivery by post, we need your postal
        address. If you ask to be included on a press distribution list, we need to know which publication you
        work for, to allow us to check whether specific publications are actually receiving our press material.
        <br>
        As a general rule, we employ the double opt-in method for the registration. In other words, after you
        have registered for the service and informed us of your e-mail address, you will receive an e-mail in
        return from us, containing a link that you must use to con-firm your registration. Your registration and
        confirmation will be recorded. The newsletter will not be sent until this has been done. This procedure
        is used to ensure that only you yourself can register with the newsletter service under the specified
        e-mail address. You must confirm your registration as soon as possible after receiving our e-mail,
        otherwise your registration and e-mail address will be erased from our database. Until we receive your
        confirmation, our newsletter service will refuse to accept any other registration re-quests using this
        e-mail address.
        <br>
        You can cancel subscriptions to our newsletters at any time. To do so, either send us an e-mail or
        follow the link at the end of the newsletter.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>​4.2 Visitors’ books and forums</b><br>
        If you wish to sign up for an Internet forum run by the Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft, we need at least a user
        ID, a password, and your e-mail address. For your own protection, the reg-istration procedure for this
        type of service, like that for the newsletters, involves you con-firming your request using the link
        contained in the e-mail we send you and you giving your consent to the use of further personal data
        where this is necessary to use the forum.
        <br>
        You can cancel your registration for this type of service at any time, by sending us an e-mail via the
        Web page offering the service.
        <br>
        As a general rule, the content of visitors’ books and forums is not subject to any form of monitoring by
        the Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft. Nevertheless, we reserve the right to delete posted contributions and to
        prohibit users from further use of the service at our own dis-cretion, especially in cases where posted
        content contravenes the law or is deemed in-compatible with the objectives of the
        Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft.
        <br>
        <br>

        <b>5. Cookies</b><br>
        We don’t normally use cookies on our Web site, but in certain exceptional cases we may use cookies which
        place technical session-control data in your browser’s memory. These data are automatically erased at
        the latest when you close your browser.
        <br>
        If, exceptionally, one of our applications requires the storage of personal data in a cookie, for
        instance a user ID, we will point out you to it.
        <br>
        Of course, it is perfectly possible to consult our Web site without the use of cookies. Please note,
        however, that most browsers are programmed to accept cookies in their de-fault configuration. You can
        prevent this by changing the appropriate setting in the browser options. If you set the browser to
        refuse all cookies, this may restrict your use of certain functions on our Website
        <br>
        <br>

        <b>6. Web analysis</b><br>
        Personal user profiles are not created. However, Section 15 (3) of the Telemedia Act (TMG) permits the
        use of user profiles under a pseudonym for the purpose of advertising, market research and the
        structuring of offers in line with the user's needs provided that the user does not object to this:
        <br>
        We also use web analysis services on our web pages, for example from etracker or WiredMinds, which carry
        out the web analysis on our behalf as contract processors (see the websites of www.wiredminds.de for
        these providers). Their services have been checked by the supervisory authorities and/or experts and
        meet all requirements under German and European data protection laws.
        <br>
        Using the technologies of these providers, data is collected and stored on our website. From this data,
        user profiles are produced under a pseudonym for marketing and optimi-zation purposes, for which cookies
        may be used. Cookies are small text files that are stored locally in the cache memory of the site
        visitor's web browser. The cookies enable the web browser to be recognized. Furthermore, your user
        behavior can be measured via a JavaScript code and data collected in this connection can be sent
        directly to the provider's servers in Germany or the EU via an HTML connection. Without your express
        consent, the data collected using the tracking technologies will not be used to personally identify you
        and will not be combined with the personal data about the bearer of the pseudonym. No cross-website
        analysis will be carried out either.
        <br>
        <br> If you wish to technically stop the tracking, you can deactivate JavaScript and cookies in your web
        browser. Consent for the collection and storage of data can also be refused with effect for the future
        at any time. Please follow this link to refuse the service provided by WiredMinds:
        <a href="http://wm.wiredminds.de">http://wm.wiredminds.de.</a>
        <br>
        <br>

        <b>7. Social plugins</b><br>
        We also use social plugins in some cases on our webpages, e.g. from the Facebook, Twit-ter, YouTube or
        Google+ social networks. These are often technically operated in the USA or in other countries outside
        Germany and the EU and some are offered via national companies in the EU (see the websites
        www.facebook.de, www.twitter.de, www.youtube.de or www.google.de for the providers). The plugins are
        identified with the companies’ logo, comment fields or what are known as a “Like” or “+1” button.
        <br>
        If you open a page of our website in your web browser containing such a plugin, your web browser will
        create a direct connection to the servers of the respective provider in the country concerned.
        <br>
        By incorporating the plugins the provider is given at the least the information that you have visited a
        certain page on our website, and perhaps also other information that your web browser or the device you
        use also discloses. The content of the plugin is loaded by your web browser directly from the provider
        and incorporated into our website. If you are registered and have logged in with the provider concerned,
        your visit can also be assigned to your user account.
        <br>
        If you interact with a plugin, e.g. if you click on the “Like” button or enter a comment in a form
        field, your browser will also transmit this information directly to the provider where it will be saved
        and, if applicable, continue to be used and published.
        <br>
        Above all, marketing measures of the provider and the Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft are the reason for the
        collection and use of the data as described and determine the extent of this. You can find details on
        this and on your rights and on ways in which you can pre-vent the collection and use of your data in
        order to protect your private sphere directly in the data privacy policy of the respective provider.
        <br>
        If you do not wish a provider to collect data on you through our website you must deacti-vate the
        plugins in your web browser. If you wish to avoid a link to any existing user account, you must log out
        before your visit to our website. By visiting our website, you de-clare your consent to the above
        provisions.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>8. Security </b><br>
        The Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft implements technical and organizational security measures to safeguard
        stored personal data against inadvertent or deliberate manipulation, loss or destruction and against
        access by unauthorized persons. Our security measures are continuously im-proved in line with
        technological progress.
        <br><br>
        <b>9. Links to Web sites operated by other providers</b><br>
        Our Web pages may contain links to other providers’ Web pages. We would like to point out that this
        statement of data protection conditions applies exclusively to the Web pages managed by the
        Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft. We have no way of influencing the practices of other providers with respect to
        data protection, nor do we carry out any checks to ensure that they conform with the relevant
        legislation.
        <br><br>
        <b>10. Right to information and contact data</b><br>
        You have a legal right to inspect any stored data concerning your person, and also the right to demand
        their correction or deletion, and to withdraw your consent for their further use.
        <br>
        In some cases, if you are a registered user of certain services provided by the Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft,
        we offer you the possibility of inspecting these data online, and even of deleting or modifying the data
        yourself, via a user account.
        <br>
        If you wish to obtain information on your personal data, or want us to correct or erase such data, or if
        you have any other questions concerning the use of personal data held by us, please contact: <a
              href="mailto:data-protection@zv.fraunhofer.de">data-protection@zv.fraunhofer.de</a>
        <br><br>
        <b>11. Acceptance, validity and modification of data protection conditions</b><br>
        By using our Web site, you implicitly agree to accept the use of your personal data as specified above.
        This present statement of data protection conditions came into effect on October 1st, 2013. As our Web
        site evolves, and new technologies come into use, it may become necessary to amend the statement of data
        protection conditions. The Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft reserves the right to modify its data protection
        conditions at any time, with effect as of a future date. We recommend that you reread the latest version
        from time to time.
