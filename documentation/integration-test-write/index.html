                          <h1 id="write-your-own-integration-tests">Write your own integration tests</h1>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>In this site we will describe how to write test cases for the integration tests. 
The test scenarios are defined in .ini files which are in the directory <strong>integration-tests/src/main/resources/integration-test-scenarios</strong>. If you want to add an integration test, just add its ini file to this folder. </p>
<h3 id="ini-file-structure">Ini file structure</h3>
<p>In the ini file you can describe a graph or tree like execution plan of different tasks. 
As an example we will implement the test which is found in the <em>scenario-real-iperf.ini</em> file step by step. 
First we need a base node and define the maximum time of the integration test and the maximum number of concurrent successors. </p>
<pre><code class="ini">[it]
;set the maximum time (in seconds) of the Integration test. e.g. 10 min = 600 seconds
max-integration-test-time = 800
;set the maximum number of concurrent successors (max number of active child threads)
max-concurrent-successors = 10
</code></pre>

<p>After that the first step is to store a vim instance to the orchestrator. </p>
<pre><code class="ini">[it]
;set the maximum time (in seconds) of the Integration test. e.g. 10 min = 600 seconds
max-integration-test-time = 800
;set the maximum number of concurrent successors (max number of active child threads)
max-concurrent-successors = 10

;vimInstance-create
[it/vim-c-1]
class-name = VimInstanceCreate
name-file = real-vim.json
</code></pre>

<p>The node we just added will create a vim instance. That is defined by the class-name field. 
The class VimInstanceCreate stores a vim instance from the <em>real-vim.json</em> file to the orchestrator. 
A complete list of classes you can use is provided later in this document. 
The file <em>real-vim.json</em> has to be stored either in <strong>/etc/openbaton/integration-tests/vim-instances/real-vim.json</strong> or in <strong>.../integration-tests/src/main/resources/etc/json_file/vim_instances/real-vim.json</strong>. 
The file in the first folder has a higher priority than the one in the second one.</p>
<p>We already know that we want to delete this vim from the orchestrator at the end of the test. 
So we can add the following:</p>
<pre><code class="ini">[it]
;set the maximum time (in seconds) of the Integration test. e.g. 10 min = 600 seconds
max-integration-test-time = 800
;set the maximum number of concurrent successors (max number of active child threads)
max-concurrent-successors = 10

;vimInstance-create
[it/vim-c-1]
class-name = VimInstanceCreate
name-file = real-vim.json
successor-remover = vim-d-1

[it/vim-c-1/vim-d-1]
class-name = VimInstanceDelete
</code></pre>

<p>The successor-remover field specifies, that the node <em>vim-d-1</em> will be executed after every child node/task of <em>vim-c-1</em> has finished. 
Every node can only have one successor-remover. 
The new node gets the information which vim instance it should delete passed from the first node. </p>
<p>The next step will be to create and delete a network service descriptor (NSD). </p>
<pre><code class="ini">[it]
;set the maximum time (in seconds) of the Integration test. e.g. 10 min = 600 seconds
max-integration-test-time = 800
;set the maximum number of concurrent successors (max number of active child threads)
max-concurrent-successors = 10

;vimInstance-create
[it/vim-c-1]
class-name = VimInstanceCreate
name-file = real-vim.json
successor-remover = vim-d-1

[it/vim-c-1/vim-d-1]
class-name = VimInstanceDelete

;nsd-create
[it/vim-c-1/nsd-c-1]
class-name = NetworkServiceDescriptorCreate
num_instances = 1
successor-remover = nsd-d-1
name-file = NetworkServiceDescriptor-iperf-real.json

;nsd-delete
[it/vim-c-1/nsd-c-1/nsd-d-1]
class-name = NetworkServiceDescriptorDelete
</code></pre>

<p>Here the new nodes are <em>nsd-c-1</em> and <em>nsd-d-1</em>. 
<em>nsd-d-1</em> is the successor remover of <em>nsd-c-1</em> and will be executed if every child node/task from <em>nsd-c-1</em> finished. 
<em>nsd-c-1</em> has some fields that need explanation. <em>num_instances</em> specifies how many of those tasks should be created. 
At the moment there is just one so only one NSD will be stored on the orchestrator. 
But if we would provide for example a 2, then this task would be executed twice concurrently. 
Every task would be independent and every child node which is defined for <em>nsd-c-1</em> would be executed for every instance separately. 
The name-file specifies the .json file that shall be used to create the NSD. 
It may be stored either in <strong>/etc/openbaton/integration-tests/network-service-descriptors/NetworkServiceDescriptor-iperf-real.json</strong> or in <strong>.../integration-tests/src/main/resources/etc/json_file/network_service_descriptors/NetworkServiceDescriptor-iperf-real.json</strong>. 
Again the former folder has a higher priority than the latter one. </p>
<p>In the next step we will deploy the network service record (NSR) from the created NSDs and wait for its instantiation. </p>
<pre><code class="ini">[it]
;set the maximum time (in seconds) of the Integration test. e.g. 10 min = 600 seconds
max-integration-test-time = 800
;set the maximum number of concurrent successors (max number of active child threads)
max-concurrent-successors = 10

;vimInstance-create
[it/vim-c-1]
class-name = VimInstanceCreate
name-file = real-vim.json
successor-remover = vim-d-1

[it/vim-c-1/vim-d-1]
class-name = VimInstanceDelete

;nsd-create
[it/vim-c-1/nsd-c-1]
class-name = NetworkServiceDescriptorCreate
num_instances = 1
successor-remover = nsd-d-1
name-file = NetworkServiceDescriptor-iperf-real.json

;nsd-delete
[it/vim-c-1/nsd-c-1/nsd-d-1]
class-name = NetworkServiceDescriptorDelete

;nsr-create
[it/vim-c-1/nsd-c-1/nsr-c-1]
class-name = NetworkServiceRecordCreate
num_instances = 1

;nsr-wait for creation
[it/vim-c-1/nsd-c-1/nsr-c-1/nsr-w-1]
class-name = NetworkServiceRecordWait
;the default timeout is 5 seconds
timeout = 600
action = INSTANTIATE_FINISH
</code></pre>

<p><em>nsr-c-1</em> works similar to the creation of a NSD. It gets its information which NSD it should use from the preceiding task, so it has to be the NSD creation node. 
The interesting part in this step is the <em>nsr-w-1</em> node. 
This waits for the orchestrator to send the action INSTANTIATE_FINISH. If it receives it, the task was successful and the integration test proceeds. </p>
<p>Now we will show how to test, if the network service is actually running.
Therefore you can tell the integration test to ssh the instantiated virtual machines and execute commands.
Those commands have to be written in scripts which can be placed in two locations.
Either in <strong>/etc/openbaton/integration-tests/scripts/</strong> or in <strong>/integration-tests/src/main/resources/etc/scripts/</strong> in the
project itself. The former directory is checked first for a script name. If it does not exist there the latter location is used. 
Bash sources the scripts on the remote machines. 
But where do I specify the Virtual Machines on which the scripts shall be executed? Well, also in the .ini file.
Use the <em>GenericServiceTester</em>.</p>

class-name = GenericServiceTester
vnf-type = client
user-name = ubuntu
vm-scripts-path = /home/ubuntu
script-1 = iperf-running.sh
script-2 = iperf-clt-connection.sh
</code></pre>

<p>The class name specifies, that we want to use the GenericServiceTester to test our service.
The vnf-type is used to say on which virtual network functions the scripts should be executed and is equal to the one you wrote into the network service descriptor.
In our example the integration test would execute them on a virtual machine, which runs the iperfserver VNF which has the type 'server'. 
In user-name you have to specify the user name of the virtual machine, so that the integration test can ssh into the machine. 
And vm-scripts-path declares the directory in which the testing scripts should be stored on the virtual machine. Keep in mind that this directory has to already exist, it will not be created by the integration test. 
And finally you have to specify the script name. script-1 will be the first script executed in that task.
If you want to execute more than that, just add script-2, script-3 and so on.</p>
<p>Here is the script <em>iperf-running.sh</em> used to see if iperf is running:</p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/bash

iperf_count=`exec ps -aux | grep -v grep | grep iperf | wc -l`
if [ $iperf_count -lt 1 ]
then
  exit 1
else
  exit 0
fi

</code></pre>

<p>As you can see the script exits with status 0 on success and otherwise on 1 like usual. 
Every script you write for the integration test should exit on a value not 0 if they fail. 
The integration test will just pass if all the scripts exit on 0.</p>
<p>So, now we know that iperf is running on the client virtual machine. But are the client and server really communicating at the moment?
To test that we added another script <em>iperf-clt-connection.sh</em> to the client task, that checks if there is an outgoing or incoming connection related to iperf and exits successfully if one exists. Here's the script:</p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/bash

# this will return the ip of the remote partner of the communication, here the iperf-server
outgoing=`sudo netstat -npt | grep iperf | awk '{print $5}' | sed 's/:.*//'` 

# check if the communication partner is really the iperf-server
if [ $outgoing == ${server_ip} ]
then
  exit 0
else
  exit 1
fi
</code></pre>

<p>(You may wonder where '${server_ip}' comes from. It is a variable provided by the integration test as explained later. 
We use sudo for the netstat command, because the iperf command was started by the root user.)</p>
<p>We now also add a node in the ini file for the server. </p>

<p>The second script for the server task looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/bash


incoming=`sudo netstat -npt | grep iperf | wc -l`

if [ $incoming -eq 0 ] 
then
  exit 1
else
  exit 0
fi
</code></pre>

<p>Here we just count if there are incoming connections to the server. </p>
<p>After the iperf-running.sh script, the iperf-srv-connection.sh script will be executed on the server virtual machines 
and on the client one's also iperf-running.sh and then the script iperf-clt-conection.sh.</p>
<p>Now imagine, that you did not specify one virtual network function component in the client's NSD, but five. And you want to test them all.
Do you have to create five tasks for that? No, if you define the task for the client as shown above, the integration test will execute
the scripts on every virtual machine, that was deployed by the vnfd with the type <em>client</em>.</p>
<p>And if you have some virtual network function components connected to two different networks but just want to test the ones connected
to one of them, you can add a <em>net-name</em> field to the task and just the ones connected to it will be involved like in the server task.</p>
<p>Afterwards we want to delete the NSDs and simutaniously wait for a message from the orchestrator, that the deletion finished. </p>

<p>As you can see the nodes <em>nsr-w-2</em> and <em>nsr-d-1</em> are both child nodes of <em>gst-2</em>. 
This means that they are executed concurrently. 
The <em>nsr-w-2</em> node waits for the action RELEASE_RESOURCES_FINISH sent by the NFVO and finishes successfully if it receives it. </p>
<p>Now are all the child nodes of <em>nsd-c-1</em> finished and its successor remover nsd-d-1 will be executed which deletes the stored NSDs. 
After that all the child nodes of <em>vim-c-1</em> finished and its successor remover <em>vim-d-1</em> starts to delete the stored vim instance. </p>
<h3 id="a-little-more-on-scripts">A little more on scripts</h3>
<p>Now we come back to the '${server_ip}' variable in the iperf-clt-connection script. As mentioned earlier this variable is provided 
by the integration test. It stores the ip of the server. If you wanted to access the IPs of the clients, you could use ${client_ip}. 
The problem is, that we could for example also have two or more instances of clients. Which ip is chosen? 
Actually the script, which contains this variable will be executed twice or more on the virtual machine until every possible substitution was handled. 
You have access to the IPs, floating IPs and configurations. 
You can access ips by writing ${vnfrtype_ip} or ${vnfrtype_network_ip} (don't forget the braces). The 'vnfrtype' in our example would be 'server' or 'client'. 
The 'network' is the virtual_link you specified in the VNFD for the VNF Component and will only retrieve the VNFC ips which are connected to this network. 
If you have more than one VNFC Instance which is deployed, so for example you have two iperf-servers 
deployed from one VNFD, then there would be two possibilities to substitute ${server_ip}. If you want to execute a script on the virtual machine of the 
iperf-client which contains this variable the integration test will do the following. Execute the script containing the 
variable with first the ip of one server. And then executing the same script, but now replacing the variable with the other ip. 
That way you just have to write one script and all the VNF Components of the VNF will be tested. 
You can access the floating ips of VNFCs by writing ${vnfrtype_fip} or ${vnfrtype_network_fip}. 
Of course, this will only work if there is a floating ip for that virtual machine. 
The configurations are accessible by typing ${vnfrtype_configurationkey}. 
For all the variables it is essential, that you enclose them with braces otherwise they won't work. </p>
<h2 id="task-execution-order">Task execution order</h2>
<p>Just to clarify the execution order of the tasks specified in the ini files here is a little example without describing what the tasks do. 
The successor-removers of a task are just executed when all the other child tasks and their subsequent tasks finished.</p>
<pre><code class="ini">[it/A]
successor-remover = H

[it/A/H]
...

[it/A/B]
...

[it/A/C]
...

[it/A/C/D]
successor-remover = G

[it/A/C/D/G]
...

[it/A/C/D/E]
...

[it/A/C/D/F]
...
</code></pre>

<p>The execution order of this example looks like this:</p>
<p><img alt="Execution order" src="../images/execution-order.png" /></p>
<p>Tasks that are side by side can run concurrently. </p>
<h2 id="other-important-information">Other important information</h2>
<p>For the integration test to be able to ssh into the virtual machines on OpenStack, you have to import a key pair in OpenStack and assign the public key of the host, on which the integration tests run, to it.
The key pair's name has to be contained in the VIM instance used for deployments on OpenStack. 
Remember to make the scripts executable, that are run for testing the actual functionlity of the deployed Network Service.
Do NOT use '-' in types of VNFDs or configuration names as you cannot use them in bash scripts. </p>
<h2 id="the-class-name-types-available">The class-name types available</h2>
<p>As mentioned earlier here is a summary of all the class-names available at the moment to use in a ini file node.</p>

<h2 id="using-vnfpackages">Using VNFPackages</h2>
<p>Here is an example on how to use VNFPackages in your tests. </p>
<pre><code class="ini">[it]
;set the maximum time (in seconds) of the Integration test. e.g. 10 min = 600 seconds
max-integration-test-time = 800
;set the maximum number of concurrent successors (max number of active child threads)
max-concurrent-successors = 10

;vimInstance-create
[it/vim-c-1]
class-name = VimInstanceCreate
name-file = vim.json
successor-remover = vim-d-1

[it/vim-c-1/vim-d-1]
class-name = VimInstanceDelete

;package-create
[it/vim-c-1/vnfp-c-1]
class-name = PackageUpload
package-name = iperf-server-package.tar
successor-remover = vnfp-d-1

;package-delete
[it/vim-c-1/vnfp-c-1/vnfp-d-1]
class-name = PackageDelete
package-name = iperfServerPackage

;nsd-create
[it/vim-c-1/vnfp-c-1/nsd-c-1]
class-name = NetworkServiceDescriptorCreateFromPackage
name-file = NetworkServiceDescriptor.json
successor-remover = nsd-d-1

;nsd-delete
[it/vim-c-1/vnfp-c-1/nsd-c-1/nsd-d-1]
class-name = NetworkServiceDescriptorDelete
</code></pre>

<p>This example begins by storing a vim instance. Then the package iperf-server-package.tar is stored by specifying the package file name in the package-name attribute. 
The packages have to be in the directory /etc/openbaton/integration-tests/vnf-packages/. 
Afterwards a NSD is created from the VNFDs in the package and right after that deleted (to keep this example short we did not create a NSR from the NSD and so on). Be aware that you 
have to use the class NetworkServiceDescriptorCreateFromPackage to store a NSD from a package. 
Then also the package will be deleted. You have to provide the name of the package you want to delete (not the file name this time but the name of the package defined in the Metadata.yaml). 
At the end the vim instance is deleted. </p>
<p>If you create a NSD from a VNFPackage, the VNFD field of the NSD file would look something like this: </p>
<pre><code class="json">&quot;vnfd&quot;:[
{
      &quot;type&quot;:&quot;server&quot;
},
{
      &quot;type&quot;:&quot;client&quot;
}

   ],
</code></pre>

<p>The integration test will search for VNFDs with these types that were previously stored by a VNFPackage and use them for creating the NSD. </p>
<h2 id="scaling">Scaling</h2>
<p>There are three testers for Scaling already implemented. The first one is <em>ScaleOut</em>. In the ini file this tester needs some additional attributes. Besides the normal <em>class-name</em> you should also specify the VNFR type on which the scale out should be performed in the field <em>vnf-type</em>. Then you can also specify the virtual-link to which the new instance should be connected using <em>virtual-link</em>. 
And you can determine a floating ip for the new instance using the field <em>floating-ip</em>. 
Here is an example of a ScaleOut task in the ini file:</p>
<pre><code class="ini">[it/.../sc-o-1]
class-name = ScaleOut
vnf-type = client
virtual-link = private
floating-ip = random
</code></pre>

<p>The second tester is <em>ScaleIn</em>. Here you can just specify on which VNFR type the scale in should be executed. An example: </p>
<pre><code class="ini">[it/.../sc-i-1]
class-name = ScaleIn
vnf-type = client
</code></pre>

<p>And the third tester is used to see if after the scaling operation there is the right number of instances running. 
Specify the VNFR type you want to test by providing <em>vnf-type</em> in the ini file and specify the number of expected VNFC instances by using <em>vnfc-count</em>. For example: </p>
<pre><code class="ini">[it/.../sc-t-1]
class-name = ScalingTester
vnf-type = client
vnfc-count = 2
</code></pre>

<p>Furthermore note that the ScalingTester passes the updated NSR to the next tester. If you trigger a scaling function the NSR will change, but if you do not use ScalingTester (or NetworkServiceRecordGetLatest) the NSR used by the integration test will remain the old one before the scaling operation. 
So the recommended proceeding after a scale out or scale in is to wait until the operation finishes and then use the <em>ScalingTester</em> or at least the <em>NetworkServiceRecordGetLatest</em> to have the updated NSR. </p>

        <p>
          The Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft zur Förderung der angewandten Forschung e.V. (Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft)
          takes the protection of your personal data very seriously. When we process the personal data that is
          collected during your visits to our Web site, we always observe the rules laid down in the
          applicable data protection laws. Your data will not be disclosed publicly by us, nor transferred to
          any third parties without your consent.
          <br>
          <br>

          <b>1. Recording and processing of data in connection with access over the Internet</b><br>
          When you visit our Web site, our Web server makes a temporary record of each access and stores it in
          a log file. The following data are recorded, and stored until an automatic deletion date:
        <ul>
          <li>IP address of the requesting processor</li>
          <li>Date and time of access</li>
          <li>Name and URL of the downloaded file</li>
          <li>Volume of data transmitted</li>
          <li>Indication whether download was successful</li>
          <li>Data identifying the browser software and operating system</li>
          <li>Web site from which our site was accessed</li>
          <li>Name of your Internet service provider</li>
        </ul>
        The purpose of recording these data is to allow use of the Web site (connection setup), for system
        security, for technical administration of the network infrastructure and in order to op-timize our
        Internet service. The IP address is only evaluated in the event of fraudulent access to the network
        infrastructure of the Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft.
        <br>
        Apart from the special cases cited above, we do not process personal data without first obtaining your
        explicit consent to do so. Pseudonymous user profiles can be created as stated under web analysis (see
        below).

        <br>
        <br>
        <b>​2. Orders</b><br>
        If you order information material or other goods via our website, we will use the address data provided
        only for the purpose of processing your order.

        <br>
        <br>
        <b>3. Use and transfer of personal data</b><br>
        All use of your personal data is confined to the purposes stated above, and is only under-taken to the
        extent necessary for these purposes. Your data is not disclosed to third parties.
        <br>
        Personal data will not be transferred to government bodies or public authorities except in order to
        comply with mandatory national legislation or if the transfer of such data should be necessary in order
        to take legal action in cases of fraudulent access to our network infrastructure. Personal data will not
        be transferred for any other purpose.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>4. Consent to use data in other contexts</b><br>

        The use of certain services on our website, such as newsletters or discussion forums, may re-quire prior
        registration and involves a more substantial processing of personal data, such as longer-term storage of
        e-mail addresses, user IDs and passwords. We use such data only insofar as it has been sent to us by you
        in person and you have given us your express prior consent for this use. For example, we request your
        consent separately in the following cases:
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>4.1 Newsletters and press distribution</b><br>

        In order to register for a newsletter service provided by the Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft, we need at least
        your e-mail address so that we know where to send the newsletter. All other information you supply is on
        a voluntary basis, and will be only if you give your consent, for example to contact you directly or
        clear up questions concerning your e-mail address. If you request delivery by post, we need your postal
        address. If you ask to be included on a press distribution list, we need to know which publication you
        work for, to allow us to check whether specific publications are actually receiving our press material.
        <br>
        As a general rule, we employ the double opt-in method for the registration. In other words, after you
        have registered for the service and informed us of your e-mail address, you will receive an e-mail in
        return from us, containing a link that you must use to con-firm your registration. Your registration and
        confirmation will be recorded. The newsletter will not be sent until this has been done. This procedure
        is used to ensure that only you yourself can register with the newsletter service under the specified
        e-mail address. You must confirm your registration as soon as possible after receiving our e-mail,
        otherwise your registration and e-mail address will be erased from our database. Until we receive your
        confirmation, our newsletter service will refuse to accept any other registration re-quests using this
        e-mail address.
        <br>
        You can cancel subscriptions to our newsletters at any time. To do so, either send us an e-mail or
        follow the link at the end of the newsletter.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>​4.2 Visitors’ books and forums</b><br>
        If you wish to sign up for an Internet forum run by the Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft, we need at least a user
        ID, a password, and your e-mail address. For your own protection, the reg-istration procedure for this
        type of service, like that for the newsletters, involves you con-firming your request using the link
        contained in the e-mail we send you and you giving your consent to the use of further personal data
        where this is necessary to use the forum.
        <br>
        You can cancel your registration for this type of service at any time, by sending us an e-mail via the
        Web page offering the service.
        <br>
        As a general rule, the content of visitors’ books and forums is not subject to any form of monitoring by
        the Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft. Nevertheless, we reserve the right to delete posted contributions and to
        prohibit users from further use of the service at our own dis-cretion, especially in cases where posted
        content contravenes the law or is deemed in-compatible with the objectives of the
        Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft.
        <br>
        <br>

        <b>5. Cookies</b><br>
        We don’t normally use cookies on our Web site, but in certain exceptional cases we may use cookies which
        place technical session-control data in your browser’s memory. These data are automatically erased at
        the latest when you close your browser.
        <br>
        If, exceptionally, one of our applications requires the storage of personal data in a cookie, for
        instance a user ID, we will point out you to it.
        <br>
        Of course, it is perfectly possible to consult our Web site without the use of cookies. Please note,
        however, that most browsers are programmed to accept cookies in their de-fault configuration. You can
        prevent this by changing the appropriate setting in the browser options. If you set the browser to
        refuse all cookies, this may restrict your use of certain functions on our Website
        <br>
        <br>

        <b>6. Web analysis</b><br>
        Personal user profiles are not created. However, Section 15 (3) of the Telemedia Act (TMG) permits the
        use of user profiles under a pseudonym for the purpose of advertising, market research and the
        structuring of offers in line with the user's needs provided that the user does not object to this:
        <br>
        We also use web analysis services on our web pages, for example from etracker or WiredMinds, which carry
        out the web analysis on our behalf as contract processors (see the websites of www.wiredminds.de for
        these providers). Their services have been checked by the supervisory authorities and/or experts and
        meet all requirements under German and European data protection laws.
        <br>
        Using the technologies of these providers, data is collected and stored on our website. From this data,
        user profiles are produced under a pseudonym for marketing and optimi-zation purposes, for which cookies
        may be used. Cookies are small text files that are stored locally in the cache memory of the site
        visitor's web browser. The cookies enable the web browser to be recognized. Furthermore, your user
        behavior can be measured via a JavaScript code and data collected in this connection can be sent
        directly to the provider's servers in Germany or the EU via an HTML connection. Without your express
        consent, the data collected using the tracking technologies will not be used to personally identify you
        and will not be combined with the personal data about the bearer of the pseudonym. No cross-website
        analysis will be carried out either.
        <br>
        <br> If you wish to technically stop the tracking, you can deactivate JavaScript and cookies in your web
        browser. Consent for the collection and storage of data can also be refused with effect for the future
        at any time. Please follow this link to refuse the service provided by WiredMinds:
        <a href="http://wm.wiredminds.de">http://wm.wiredminds.de.</a>
        <br>
        <br>

        <b>7. Social plugins</b><br>
        We also use social plugins in some cases on our webpages, e.g. from the Facebook, Twit-ter, YouTube or
        Google+ social networks. These are often technically operated in the USA or in other countries outside
        Germany and the EU and some are offered via national companies in the EU (see the websites
        www.facebook.de, www.twitter.de, www.youtube.de or www.google.de for the providers). The plugins are
        identified with the companies’ logo, comment fields or what are known as a “Like” or “+1” button.
        <br>
        If you open a page of our website in your web browser containing such a plugin, your web browser will
        create a direct connection to the servers of the respective provider in the country concerned.
        <br>
        By incorporating the plugins the provider is given at the least the information that you have visited a
        certain page on our website, and perhaps also other information that your web browser or the device you
        use also discloses. The content of the plugin is loaded by your web browser directly from the provider
        and incorporated into our website. If you are registered and have logged in with the provider concerned,
        your visit can also be assigned to your user account.
        <br>
        If you interact with a plugin, e.g. if you click on the “Like” button or enter a comment in a form
        field, your browser will also transmit this information directly to the provider where it will be saved
        and, if applicable, continue to be used and published.
        <br>
        Above all, marketing measures of the provider and the Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft are the reason for the
        collection and use of the data as described and determine the extent of this. You can find details on
        this and on your rights and on ways in which you can pre-vent the collection and use of your data in
        order to protect your private sphere directly in the data privacy policy of the respective provider.
        <br>
        If you do not wish a provider to collect data on you through our website you must deacti-vate the
        plugins in your web browser. If you wish to avoid a link to any existing user account, you must log out
        before your visit to our website. By visiting our website, you de-clare your consent to the above
        provisions.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>8. Security </b><br>
        The Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft implements technical and organizational security measures to safeguard
        stored personal data against inadvertent or deliberate manipulation, loss or destruction and against
        access by unauthorized persons. Our security measures are continuously im-proved in line with
        technological progress.
        <br><br>
        <b>9. Links to Web sites operated by other providers</b><br>
        Our Web pages may contain links to other providers’ Web pages. We would like to point out that this
        statement of data protection conditions applies exclusively to the Web pages managed by the
        Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft. We have no way of influencing the practices of other providers with respect to
        data protection, nor do we carry out any checks to ensure that they conform with the relevant
        legislation.
        <br><br>
        <b>10. Right to information and contact data</b><br>
        You have a legal right to inspect any stored data concerning your person, and also the right to demand
        their correction or deletion, and to withdraw your consent for their further use.
        <br>
        In some cases, if you are a registered user of certain services provided by the Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft,
        we offer you the possibility of inspecting these data online, and even of deleting or modifying the data
        yourself, via a user account.
        <br>
        If you wish to obtain information on your personal data, or want us to correct or erase such data, or if
        you have any other questions concerning the use of personal data held by us, please contact: <a
              href="mailto:data-protection@zv.fraunhofer.de">data-protection@zv.fraunhofer.de</a>
        <br><br>
        <b>11. Acceptance, validity and modification of data protection conditions</b><br>
        By using our Web site, you implicitly agree to accept the use of your personal data as specified above.
        This present statement of data protection conditions came into effect on October 1st, 2013. As our Web
        site evolves, and new technologies come into use, it may become necessary to amend the statement of data
        protection conditions. The Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft reserves the right to modify its data protection
        conditions at any time, with effect as of a future date. We recommend that you reread the latest version
        from time to time.
